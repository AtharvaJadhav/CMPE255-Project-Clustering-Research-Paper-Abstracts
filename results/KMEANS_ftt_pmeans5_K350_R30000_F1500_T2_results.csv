0,9632495,Intracellular mechanisms underlying the nicotinic enhancement of LTP in the rat dentate gyrus,"We have previously shown that activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the rat dentate gyrus in vitro via activation of α7 nAChR. In the present studies, mechanisms underlying the acute and chronic nicotinic enhancement of LTP were examined. In particular, the involvement of activation of intracellular kinases was examined using selective kinase antagonists, and the effects of enhancing cholinergic function with positive allosteric modulators of the α7 nAChR and with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors were also investigated. Activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) was found to be involved in the induction of the acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP, although not control LTP. In contrast, activation of the tyrosine kinase Src, Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, Janus kinase 2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase was not involved in the acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP, although Src activation was necessary for control LTP. Moreover, activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase was involved in the acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP to a much lesser extent than in control LTP. Chronic nicotine enhancement of LTP was found to be dependent on PKA, ERK and Src kinases. Acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP was occluded by chronic nicotine treatment. The positive allosteric modulator PNU-120596 was found to strongly reduce the threshold for nicotinic enhancement of LTP, an affect mediated via the α7 nAChR as it was blocked by the selective antagonist methyllycaconitine.

Two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation analyses showed that RACK1 and &#946;-arrestin interact with PDE4D5 in a mutually exclusive manner. Overlay studies with PDE4D5 scanning peptide array libraries showed that RACK1 and &#946;-arrestin interact at overlapping sites within the unique N-terminal region of PDE4D5 and at distinct sites within the conserved PDE4 catalytic domain. Screening scanning alanine substitution peptide arrays, coupled with mutagenesis and truncation studies, allowed definition of RACK1 and &#946;-arrestin interaction sites. Modelled on the PDE4D catalytic domain, these form distinct well-defined surface-exposed patches on helices-15–16, for RACK1, and helix-17 for &#946;-arrestin. siRNA (small interfering RNA)-mediated knockdown of RACK1 in HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney) B2 cells increased &#946;-arrestin-scaffolded PDE4D5 approx. 5-fold, increased PDE4D5 recruited to the &#946;2AR (&#946;2-adrenergic receptor) upon isoproterenol challenge approx. 4-fold and severely attenuated (approx. 4–5 fold) both isoproterenol-stimulated PKA (protein kinase A) phosphorylation of the &#946;2AR and activation of ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase). The ability of a catalytically inactive form of PDE4D5 to exert a dominant negative effect in amplifying isoproterenol-stimulated ERK activation was ablated by a mutation that blocked the interaction of PDE4D5 with &#946;-arrestin. In the present study, we show that the signalling scaffold proteins RACK1 and &#946;-arrestin compete to sequester distinct ‘pools’ of PDE4D5. In this fashion, alterations in the level of RACK1 expression may act to modulate signal transduction mediated by the &#946;2AR.",0.025696744242748926,282289,Novel areas of crosstalk between the cyclic AMP and PKC signalling pathways,"Mediation of biological functions occurs via tightly regulated signal transduction pathways. These complex cascades often employ crosstalk with other signalling pathways to exert strict control to allow for correct cellular responses. The cyclic AMP signalling pathway is involved in a wide range of cellular processes which require tight control, including cell proliferation and differentiation, metabolism and inflammation. Protein Kinase C (PKC) signalling is also involved in the regulation of many biological functions, due to the wide range of PKC isoforms, and there is emerging evidence that there are critical points of crosstalk between these two central signalling pathways. The aims of this research, therefore, are to identify the molecular basis underlying this pivotal cross-communication.

The identification of the complex formed by Receptor for activated C Kinase 1 (RACK1), a scaffold protein for PKC, and the cyclic AMP-specific phosphodiesterase PDE4D5 demonstrated a potential area of crosstalk between the cyclic AMP and PKC signalling pathways although the function of the complex remained largely unknown. In this thesis I have outlined a role for RACK1 binding to PDE4D5 to control the enzymatic activity of the phosphodiesterase. Although RACK1 does not affect the intracellular localisation of PDE4D5, it does afford structural stability to PDE4D5, providing protection against denaturation. Furthermore, interaction with RACK1 facilitates high affinity binding of PDE4D5 to cyclic AMP and increases phosphodiesterase sensitivity to inhibition by rolipram, a PDE4-specific inhibitor that is a therapeutic treatment for depression and Alzheimer’s disease. Additionally, RACK1-bound PDE4D5 was found to be activated by PKCα, providing a route of negative regulation by PKC on cyclic AMP in HEK293 cells. 

The discovery of EPAC (Exchange Protein directly Activated by Cyclic AMP) has opened up the field of cyclic AMP research, providing an alternative route for the cyclic AMP signalling originally thought to occur solely through Protein Kinase A (PKA). Recent investigations have linked cyclic AMP signalling via EPAC to the control of inflammation, through the induction of Suppressor of Cytokine Signalling 3 (SOCS-3) to inhibit IL-6 signalling. Here I have further delineated this pathway in COS1 to show that induction of SOCS-3 by EPAC requires phospholipase C (PLC) ε. Investigation into downstream effectors of PLC action lead to the identification of PKCα and PKCδ as essential components of this pathway, further elucidating a mechanism by which cyclic AMP can affect inflammation and revealing a point of crosstalk between the two signalling pathways.

Further elaborating on the identification of PKC isoforms α and δ as crucial components in the control of cytokine signalling by cyclic AMP via EPAC, investigations into the effect of cyclic AMP on PKC α and δ activation and autophosphorylation, and on downstream effectors, were carried out. It was revealed that cyclic AMP had no influence on PKCδ activity, although a role for cyclic AMP signalling through EPAC on the activation and autophosphorylation of PKCα was identified. Additionally, phosphorylation of the downstream kinase ERK was found to occur independently of PKC activation and required the presence of EPAC1 in COS1 cells.

The work presented in this thesis therefore begins to delineate a novel pathway in which the cyclic AMP and PKC pathways work together to afford cell regulation, including the regulation of gene expression, through novel areas of crosstalk.",0.027025771828971812,99719,Opposing Changes in Phosphorylation of Specific Sites in Synapsin I During Ca2-Dependent Glutamate Release in Isolated Nerve Terminals,"Synapsins are major neuronal phosphoproteins involved in regulation
of neurotransmitter release. Synapsins are well established
targets for multiple protein kinases within the nerve
terminal, yet little is known about dephosphorylation processes
involved in regulation of synapsin function. Here, we observed
a reciprocal relationship in the phosphorylation–dephosphorylation
of the established phosphorylation sites on synapsin I.
We demonstrate that, in vitro, phosphorylation sites 1, 2, and 3
of synapsin I (P-site 1 phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent
protein kinase; P-sites 2 and 3 phosphorylated by Ca2–
calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) were excellent substrates
for protein phosphatase 2A, whereas P-sites 4, 5, and 6 (phosphorylated
by mitogen-activated protein kinase) were efficiently
dephosphorylated only by Ca2–calmodulin-dependent protein
phosphatase 2B–calcineurin. In isolated nerve terminals, rapid
changes in synapsin I phosphorylation were observed after Ca2
entry, namely, a Ca2-dependent phosphorylation of P-sites 1, 2,
and 3 and a Ca2-dependent dephosphorylation of P-sites 4, 5,
and 6. Inhibition of calcineurin activity by cyclosporin A resulted in
a complete block of Ca2-dependent dephosphorylation of
P-sites 4, 5, and 6 and correlated with a prominent increase in
ionomycin-evoked glutamate release. These two opposing, rapid,
Ca2-dependent processes may play a crucial role in the modulation
of synaptic vesicle trafficking within the presynaptic terminal.",0.028235889062864672,2753595,The in vitro and in vivo enantioselectivity of etomidate implicates the GABAA receptor in general anaesthesia,"General anaesthetics exhibiting enantioselectivity afford valuable tools to assess the fundamental mechanisms underlying anaesthesia. Here, we characterised the actions of the R-(+)- and S-(−)-enantiomers of etomidate. In mice and tadpoles, R-(+)-etomidate was more potent (˜10-fold) than S-(−)-etomidate in producing loss of the righting reflex. In electrophysiological and radioligand binding assays, the enantiomers of etomidate positively regulated GABAA receptor function at anaesthetic concentrations and with an enantioselectivity paralleling their in vivo activity. GABA-evoked currents mediated by human recombinant GABAA receptors were potentiated by either R-(+)- or S-(−)-etomidate in a manner dependent upon receptor subunit composition. A direct, GABA-mimetic, effect was similarly subunit dependent. Modulation of GABA receptor activity was selective; R-(+)-etomidate inhibited nicotinic acetylcholine, or 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptor subtypes only at supra-clinical concentrations and ionotropic glutamate receptor isoforms were essentially unaffected. Acting upon reticulothalamic neurones in rat brain slices, R-(+)-etomidate prolonged the duration of miniature IPSCs and modestly enhanced their peak amplitude. S-(−)-etomidate exerted qualitatively similar, but weaker, actions. In a model of locomotor activity, fictive swimming in Xenopus laevis tadpoles, R-(+)- but not S-(−)-etomidate exerted a depressant influence via enhancement of GABAergic neurotransmission. Collectively, these observations strongly implicate the GABAA receptor as a molecular target relevant to the anaesthetic action of etomidate.",0.028383499282546576
1,10359,Radiocarbon and stable carbon analysis of dissolved methane and carbon dioxide from the profile of a raised peat bog,"We developed and tested a new method to separate CO2 and CH4 from bulk gas samples for radiocarbon  and stable-carbon analysis that utilizes zeolite molecular sieve. To validate the technique, tests were performed using a suite of standard gases, composed of CO2 and CH4 of distinctly different isotopic composition. We employed the method to investigate the carbon isotopic composition of samples of dissolved CO2 and CH4 collected in situ from the near surface to deep layers of an ombrotrophic raised peat bog. Results showed that the age of both the CO2 and CH4 components of the dissolved gases increased with depth from ~ 0–300 BP at 0.25 m to ~ 4000 BP at 4 m. CH4 was mainly similar or slightly older in age compared to CO2, with the greatest difference in ages occurring at 1 m depth where CH4 was older by 430-615 years. The &#948;13C values of CO2 increased with depth from -12.4 ‰ and -8.0 ‰ at 0.25 m to +6.9 ‰ and +8.3 ‰ at 4 m, whereas the &#948;13C of CH4 stayed in the range -58.4 ‰ to -70.6 ‰. The 14C results from the deepest layers are consistent with a similar source for both gases. 14C ages for the CO2 component were younger compared to CH4, within the shallower depths of the peat bog (&#8804; 1 m) and demonstrate the incorporation of acrotelm-derived respired CO2 into the catotelm.",1592242,Numerical modelling of basin-scale impact crater formation,"Understanding of basin-scale crater formation is limited; only a few examples
of basin-scale craters exist and these are difficult to access. The approach
adopted in this research was to numerically model basin-scale impacts with
the aim of understanding the basin-forming process and basin structure.
Research was divided into: (1) investigating early stage formation processes
(impactor survivability), (2) investigating later stage formation processes
(excavation and modification) and basin structure, and (3) constraining an
impact scenario for the largest lunar crater, the South Pole-Aitken Basin.
Various impact parameters were investigated, quantifying their effect on the
basin-forming process.
Simulations showed impactor survivability, the fraction of impactor remaining
solid during the impact process, greatly increased if the impactor
was prolate in shape (vertical length > horizontal length) rather than spherical.
Low (≲15 km/s) impact velocities and low impact angles (≲30 ) also
noticeably increased survivability.
Lunar basin-scale simulations removed a significant volume of crustal material
during impact, producing thinner post-impact crustal layers than those
suggested by gravity-derived basin data. Most simulations formed large, predominantly
mantle, melt pools; inclusion of a steep target thermal gradient
and high internal temperatures greatly influenced melt volume production.
Differences in crustal thickness between simulations and gravity-derived data
could be accounted for by differentiation of the voluminous impact-generated
melt pools, predicted by the simulations, into new crustal layers. Assuming
differentiation occurs, simulation results were used to predict features such as
transient crater size for a suite of lunar basins and tentatively suggest lunar
thermal conditions during the basin-forming epoch. Additional simulations
concerned the formation of the South Pole-Aitken Basin. By constraining
simulation results to geochemical and gravity-derived basin data, a best-fit
impact scenario for the South Pole-Aitken Basin was found.",0.02973499336153862,2800455,Using earth observation data to evaluate the performance of a land surface model at high northern latitudes,"Recent decades have seen large changes in the environment of high northern latitude land areas, including warming and changes in snow and vegetation cover, and these are the subject of research using increasingly sophisticated models. There is a need to evaluate the models against observational data, both to quantify the performance of the current models and to guide future developments. Although data from field campaigns are an important resource, Earth Observation (EO) products are increasingly being used as the only practicable means for evaluation at the large spatial scales over which models are routinely applied.
The Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) is a process-based model that simulates the fluxes of carbon, water, energy and momentum between the land surface and the atmosphere. JULES includes parameterisations of cold season processes, including a multi-layer model of the snow pack and soil freezing and thawing processes. In this paper we compare simulations of the Northern Hemisphere using JULES to a range of EO products. The EO products monitor snow cover (e.g. from ESA DUE GlobSnow, MODIS), snow water equivalent (e.g. GlobSnow), surface state (frozen/unfrozen/melting, from ESA STSE ALANIS-Methane/DUE Permafrost) and surface temperature (e.g. AATSR, MODIS).
Uncertainty in the EO products arises in part because these products themselves involve models of radiative transfer processes. By comparing several quantities from a range of products we develop a consistent picture of the performance of JULES over large areas, and get a qualitative estimate of EO uncertainty. We also investigate uncertainty in the outputs from JULES that arises from uncertainties in the parameterisations and in the input data (e.g. meteorology). We propose to incorporate EO products that describe snow and frozen ground into the routine benchmarking of JULES and other land surface models.",0.031619011509933403,61049,Rapid geohazard assessment system for the UK Natural Gas Pipeline Network,"The British Geological Survey (BGS) and National Grid Transco (NGT) have produced a new GIS for the rapid assessment of the potential for a significant geohazard to adversely affect any section of the UK natural gas pipeline transmission network. NGT is responsible for the safety and maintenance of the 18 000 km long high-pressure transmission network that supplies gas to business and domestic consumers across the UK.
Health and Safety Legislation in the UK requires NGT to demonstrate that the risks to individuals living and working in the vicinity of gas pipelines are adequately managed. In order to enhance its capabilities for assessing the risks due to geological ground conditions NGT required detailed information about the distribution and potential severity of geohazards across the UK. BGS, as the primary holder of national geological hazard data in the UK, were commissioned to design suitable GIS layers as part of the risk assessment methodology.
Of the many geohazards that affect the UK, landsliding and the dissolution of soluble rocks were considered to pose the greatest threat to the transmission network. Other hazards, such as clay shrinkage, running sand and compressible ground, were considered to be of significance only during pipeline construction and were not thought likely to cause rupture during operation. BGS national hazard datasets for landslide and dissolution hazard were truncated to buffer zones centred upon the pipeline. These data were enhanced by detailed information from the BGS National Landslide Database and Karst Database.
The result of this research was a set of continuous GIS layers that show the level of potential hazard from landsliding or dissolution of soluble rocks at any location on the pipeline network in the UK. NGT will be using this data to: improve their risk assessment methodology in this area; inform discussions on pipeline safety with their safety regulator and to improve their surveillance strategies where it is considered that geohazards represent a potential threat to the integrity of the pipeline.",0.03181963159164325,9706,Analysis of the fractal clustering of ore deposits in the Spanish Iberian Pyrite Belt,"The Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB) contains one of the greatest known concentrations of volcanic-hosted massive
sulfides (VHMS) on Earth. Investigation of the spatial attributes of the mineralization using fractal methods,
over a range of scales, and integrated within a GIS provides new information, of potential import to the
exploration of VHMS deposits. At the mine-scale, stockworks, which act as feeders for hydrothermal fluids,
show vein thickness distributions that are power-law (Dt≈0.65 in one dimension) at length scales from
about 10−2 to 102 m. Box-counting of veins indicates a capacity dimension (Dc) in the range of 1.60–1.65 in
two dimensions, which is consistent with the vein thickness data. At larger scales, in the range 103 to 105 m,
the distribution of mines and mineral prospects can be modelled as a fractal dust. When all the known
mineral deposits and prospects are analyzed they have a capacity dimension Dc≈1.3. The VHMS deposits
alone have a capacity dimension Dc≈0.9, indicating that they are clustered, with some indication that the
‘world-class’ deposits may be even more clustered. The different fractal analyses are integrated with
information from geological and geophysical maps using a GIS. The distribution of prospects has been
simulated using a simple multifractal model of the ore concentration and is constrained by known geological
controls. Such a model has been implemented through the GIS.",0.03291009000262424,9543401,A novel palaeoaltimetry proxy based on spore and pollen wall chemistry,"Understanding the uplift history and the evolution of high altitude plateaux is of major interest to a wide range of geoscientists and has implications for many disparate fields.  Currently the majority of palaeoaltimetry proxies are based on detecting a physical change in climate in response to uplift, making the relationship between uplift and climate difficult to decipher. Furthermore, current palaeoaltimetry proxies have a low degree of precision with errors typically greater than 1 km.  This makes the calculation of uplift histories and the identification of the mechanisms responsible for uplift difficult to determine.  Here we report on advances in both instrumentation and our understanding of the biogeochemical structure of sporopollenin that are leading to the establishment of a new proxy to track changes in the flux of UV-B radiation over geological time.  The UV-B proxy is based on quantifying changes in the concentration of UV-B absorbing compounds (UACs) found in the spores and pollen grains of land plants, with the relative abundances of UACs increasing on exposure to elevated UV-B radiation.  Given the physical relationship between altitude and UV-B radiation we suggest that the analysis of sporopollenin chemistry, specifically changes in the concentration of UACs, may offer the basis for the first climate independent palaeoaltimetry proxy.  Owing to the ubiquity of spores and pollen in the fossil record our proposed proxy has the potential to enable the reconstruction of the uplift history of high altitude plateaux at unprecedented levels of fidelity, both spatially and temporally.",0.03331677512079201
