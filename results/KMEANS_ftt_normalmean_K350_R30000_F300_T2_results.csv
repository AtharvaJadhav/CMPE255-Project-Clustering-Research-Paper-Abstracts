0,9632495,Intracellular mechanisms underlying the nicotinic enhancement of LTP in the rat dentate gyrus,"We have previously shown that activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the rat dentate gyrus in vitro via activation of α7 nAChR. In the present studies, mechanisms underlying the acute and chronic nicotinic enhancement of LTP were examined. In particular, the involvement of activation of intracellular kinases was examined using selective kinase antagonists, and the effects of enhancing cholinergic function with positive allosteric modulators of the α7 nAChR and with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors were also investigated. Activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) was found to be involved in the induction of the acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP, although not control LTP. In contrast, activation of the tyrosine kinase Src, Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, Janus kinase 2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase was not involved in the acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP, although Src activation was necessary for control LTP. Moreover, activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase was involved in the acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP to a much lesser extent than in control LTP. Chronic nicotine enhancement of LTP was found to be dependent on PKA, ERK and Src kinases. Acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP was occluded by chronic nicotine treatment. The positive allosteric modulator PNU-120596 was found to strongly reduce the threshold for nicotinic enhancement of LTP, an affect mediated via the α7 nAChR as it was blocked by the selective antagonist methyllycaconitine. The AChE inhibitors tacrine and physostigmine enhanced control LTP.",9632495,Intracellular mechanisms underlying the nicotinic enhancement of LTP in the rat dentate gyrus,"We have previously shown that activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the rat dentate gyrus in vitro via activation of α7 nAChR.

This phenomenon, known as pharmacological preconditioning, decreases infarct size and increases the functional recovery of the intact heart. The role of protein kinases and ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP) in phenylephrine preconditioning was investigated in isolated ventricular myocytes using whole cell patch clamp, western blotting, fluorescence imaging and measurement of contractile activity. The role of PKC isoforms was examined using isoform-specific PKC activator and inhibitor peptides.
Preconditioning with phenylephrine increased the contractile recovery of isolated ventricular myocytes following simulated ischaemia and reperfusion, and this was also correlated with an improvement in calcium homeostasis during reperfusion. The protective effect of phenylephrine preconditioning on contractile recovery was abolished by inhibition of α1-adrenoceptors, PKC or KATP. We observed a sustained activation of PKCε and δ in response to phenylephrine preconditioning, and identified a protective role for PKCε. PKCδ was required for phenylephrine preconditioning but also increased reperfusion injury. CaMKK, AMPK and p38 MAPK were all required for phenylephrine preconditioning, and activation of AMPK by phenylephrine preconditioning required PKCδ. However, both JNK and ERK appear not to be involved in the protective effect.
Inhibition of sarcolemmal KATP channels (sarcKATP) or mitochondrial KATP channels (mitoKATP) prevented preconditioning. Peak sarcKATP current activated by metabolic inhibition was increased following phenylephrine preconditioning and inhibition of PKCδ, AMPK or p38 MAPK was sufficient to prevent the increase in current.
Increased sarcKATP current can enhance hyperpolarisation of the resting membrane potential, and may be responsible for the observed decrease in calcium loading and improved contractile recovery of phenylephrine preconditioned ventricular myocytes following ischaemia and reperfusion.",0.04290554239482358,99719,Opposing Changes in Phosphorylation of Specific Sites in Synapsin I During Ca2-Dependent Glutamate Release in Isolated Nerve Terminals,"Synapsins are major neuronal phosphoproteins involved in regulation
of neurotransmitter release. Synapsins are well established
targets for multiple protein kinases within the nerve
terminal, yet little is known about dephosphorylation processes
involved in regulation of synapsin function. Here, we observed
a reciprocal relationship in the phosphorylation–dephosphorylation
of the established phosphorylation sites on synapsin I.
We demonstrate that, in vitro, phosphorylation sites 1, 2, and 3
of synapsin I (P-site 1 phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent
protein kinase; P-sites 2 and 3 phosphorylated by Ca2–
calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) were excellent substrates
for protein phosphatase 2A, whereas P-sites 4, 5, and 6 (phosphorylated
by mitogen-activated protein kinase) were efficiently
dephosphorylated only by Ca2–calmodulin-dependent protein
phosphatase 2B–calcineurin. In isolated nerve terminals, rapid
changes in synapsin I phosphorylation were observed after Ca2
entry, namely, a Ca2-dependent phosphorylation of P-sites 1, 2,
and 3 and a Ca2-dependent dephosphorylation of P-sites 4, 5,
and 6. Inhibition of calcineurin activity by cyclosporin A resulted in
a complete block of Ca2-dependent dephosphorylation of
P-sites 4, 5, and 6 and correlated with a prominent increase in
ionomycin-evoked glutamate release. These two opposing, rapid,
Ca2-dependent processes may play a crucial role in the modulation
of synaptic vesicle trafficking within the presynaptic terminal.",0.04475262882689479,5222960,an investigation into the role of neurotransmitter receptors in the function of human immune cells,"The interaction between the nervous and immune system is well documented, although is still not fully understood - particularly the impact of neurotransmitter receptors on immune cell function. 5-HT\(_3\)A receptor expression was identified on activated regulatory T cells (Treg) but not on effector T cells. Incubation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with the 5-HT\(_3\) receptor agonist DDP733 and the positive allosteric modulator 5-chloroindole increased the percentage of CD25+FoxP3+ lymphoyctes (Treg phenotype). Proliferation of PBMC was inhibited by DDP733 plus 5-chloroindole indicating functional impact by the 5-HT\(_3\) receptor. The GPR55 receptor was also expressed by human T cells. The GPR55 agonist lysophosphatidylinositol increased cell viability by preventing apoptosis. However, the induced response was not blocked by the GPR55 receptor antagonist cannabidiol casting doubt over the GPR55 receptor mediating the response. Cannabidiol was demonstrated to have a pro-apoptotic effect in its own right, although whether this effect is mediated by GPR55 or the CB2 cannabinoid receptor is unknown. Further experiments are required to elucidate the role of the 5-HT\(_3\)A receptor in lymphocyte function and the mechanism responsible for the immunoprotective role of lysophosphatidylinositol.",0.04728287095946149,19265,The novel Syk inhibitor R406 reveals mechanistic differences in the initiation of GPVI and CLEC-2 signaling in platelets,"Background: Syk is a key mediator of signaling pathways downstream of several platelet surface receptors including GPVI/FcRc collagen receptor, the C-type lectin receptor CLEC-2, and integrin aIIbb3. A recent study identified the novel small molecule R406 as a selective inhibitor of Syk. Objectives: The present study evaluates the role of Syk in human platelets using the novel inhibitor R406. Methods: Agonist-induced GPVI and CLEC-2 signaling were assessed using aggregometry, immunoprecipitation and western blotting to determine the effects of R406 on platelet activation. Results: We demonstrate R406 to be a powerful inhibitor of Syk in human platelets. R406 abrogated shape change and aggregation induced by activation of GPVI and CLEC-2, and reduced platelet spreading on fibrinogen. The inhibitory effect of R406 was associated with inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling proteins that lay downstream of Syk for all three receptors, including PLCc2.Strikingly, R406 markedly inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of CLEC-2 and Syk downstream of CLEC-2 activation,whereas phosphorylation of Syk downstream of GPVI and integrin aIIbb3 was unaffected. Conclusions: The inhibitory effect of R406 provides direct evidence of a role for Syk in GPVI, CLEC-2 and integrin aIIbb3 signaling in human platelets. Further, the results demonstrate a critical role for Syk in mediating tyrosine phosphorylation of CLEC-2,suggesting a novel model in which both Src and Syk kinases mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of the C-type lectin receptor leading to platelet activation.",0.04860603445072742

To validate the technique, tests were performed using a suite of standard gases, composed of CO2 and CH4 of distinctly different isotopic composition. We employed the method to investigate the carbon isotopic composition of samples of dissolved CO2 and CH4 collected in situ from the near surface to deep layers of an ombrotrophic raised peat bog. Results showed that the age of both the CO2 and CH4 components of the dissolved gases increased with depth from ~ 0–300 BP at 0.25 m to ~ 4000 BP at 4 m. CH4 was mainly similar or slightly older in age compared to CO2, with the greatest difference in ages occurring at 1 m depth where CH4 was older by 430-615 years. The &#948;13C values of CO2 increased with depth from -12.4 ‰ and -8.0 ‰ at 0.25 m to +6.9 ‰ and +8.3 ‰ at 4 m, whereas the &#948;13C of CH4 stayed in the range -58.4 ‰ to -70.6 ‰. The 14C results from the deepest layers are consistent with a similar source for both gases. 14C ages for the CO2 component were younger compared to CH4, within the shallower depths of the peat bog (&#8804; 1 m) and demonstrate the incorporation of acrotelm-derived respired CO2 into the catotelm.",1395050,"HREM studies of intergrowths in Sr<sub>2</sub>[Sr<sub>n</sub><sub>-</sub><sub>1</sub>Ti<sub>n</sub>O<sub>3n</sub><sub>+</sub><sub>1</sub>] Ruddlesden-Popper
phases synthesized by mechanochemical activation","A mechanochemical activation route has been applied in order to obtain the n=1–4 and &#8734; members of the Sr2[Srn−1TinO3n+1] Ruddlesden–
Popper series from different (n+1)SrO:nTiO2 mixtures. The mechanosynthesis of SrTiO3 and Sr2TiO4 was observed during the milling process
from the initial stoichiometric mixture, but in the cases of the n=2–4 members, a subsequent thermal treatment was needed. The synthesis
protocol of Sr3Ti2O7 has been greatly improved and this compound can be isolated as a single, crystalline phase after annealing at 800&#176;C. In the
case of Sr4Ti3O10 and Sr5Ti4O13, the formation temperature was also decreased, but members with n=3 and 4 could not be isolated. Detailed
investigations using electron microscopy methods (TEM, HREM and SAED) were carried out in the samples corresponding to n=2–4. Although
a single ordered Sr3Ti2O7 structure is dominant in the sample corresponding to n=2, a few intergrowths of other Ruddlesden–Popper phases were
observed. In the cases of n=3 and 4, the intergrowths of Ruddlesden–Popper phases are more frequent than in the n=2 composition and are
randomly distributed in the sample. The more frequent occurrence of such stacking faults, with increasing n value, leads to a somewhat disordered
layer stacking sequence.",0.07731263683408662,2761041,"Synthesis, structure and catalytic activity of phosphine-substituted zirconium salicylaldiminato complexes","The reaction of the lithium iminophenolate LiOC6H3-2-But-6-CH==as m-dash"" border=""0"">NAr, where Ar = 3-C6H4P{C6H3(CF3)2-3,5}2, [Li(O–NP)] with ZrCl4 affords ZrCl2(O–NP)2. Whereas previously reported zirconium bis(salicylaldiminato) complexes are typified by the trans orientation of the O-atoms, the molecular structure ZrCl2(O–NP)2 is unusual in adopting an all-cis arrangement of N, O and Cl donors. The crystal structure of the parent ligand, HOC6H3-2-But-6-CH==as m-dash"" border=""0"">NC6H4PPh2-3, is reported for comparison.

This measurement is combined with previous estimates of the H2O abundance close to KL to obtain an [HDO]:[H2O] ratio of 9.5(±1.5) x 10-3. The systematic model-dependence of this ratio is examined in some detail, to show how reliably it may be used to obtain a radial gradient of [HDO]:[H2O], and hence of [D]:[H], within the Galaxy.",0.0981338726777532,2761036,"Synthesis and structures of diphosphinoamide complexes of nickel, palladium and platinum","Lithium bis(diphenylphosphino)amide, (THF)3LiN(PPh2)2 reacts with Ni(COD)2 or PtMe2(COD) to give the corresponding bimetallic complexes (THF)3LiN(PPh2)2Ni(COD) and (THF)3LiN(PPh2)2PtMe2. Reaction of (THF)3LiN(PPh2)2Ni(COD) with Me3SnCl gave the Ni–Sn derivative, also accessible from Me3SnN(PPh2)2. The silyl derivatives Me3SiN(PPh2)2M [M = Ni(COD), PtMe2] were obtained similarly as red and colourless crystals, respectively. By contrast, the reaction with PdCl2(COD) afforded an insoluble yellow adduct which, on attempted recrystallisation afforded a small amount of a Pd(I) product, [PdCl{HN(PPh2)2}]2.
