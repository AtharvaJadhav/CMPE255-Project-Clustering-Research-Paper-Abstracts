0,9632495,Intracellular mechanisms underlying the nicotinic enhancement of LTP in the rat dentate gyrus,"We have previously shown that activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the rat dentate gyrus in vitro via activation of α7 nAChR. In the present studies, mechanisms underlying the acute and chronic nicotinic enhancement of LTP were examined. In particular, the involvement of activation of intracellular kinases was examined using selective kinase antagonists, and the effects of enhancing cholinergic function with positive allosteric modulators of the α7 nAChR and with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors were also investigated. Activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) was found to be involved in the induction of the acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP, although not control LTP. In contrast, activation of the tyrosine kinase Src, Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, Janus kinase 2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase was not involved in the acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP, although Src activation was necessary for control LTP. Moreover, activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase was involved in the acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP to a much lesser extent than in control LTP. Chronic nicotine enhancement of LTP was found to be dependent on PKA, ERK and Src kinases. Acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP was occluded by chronic nicotine treatment. The positive allosteric modulator PNU-120596 was found to strongly reduce the threshold for nicotinic enhancement of LTP, an affect mediated via the α7 nAChR as it was blocked by the selective antagonist methyllycaconitine. The AChE inhibitors tacrine and physostigmine enhanced control LTP.",9632495,Intracellular mechanisms underlying the nicotinic enhancement of LTP in the rat dentate gyrus,"We have previously shown that activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the rat dentate gyrus in vitro via activation of α7 nAChR.

The major effect of adenosine is to suppress network activity via the activation of A1 receptors. Here we report that in immature cerebellar slices, the activation of A1 receptors has variable effects on parallel fibre synaptic transmission, ranging from zero depression to an almost complete abolition of transmission. Concentration–response curves suggest that the heterogeneity of inhibition stems from differences in A1 receptor properties which could include coupling to downstream effectors. There is less variation in the effects of adenosine at parallel fibre synapses in slices from older rats and thus adenosine signalling appears developmentally regulated.
In the cerebellum, hypoxia increases the concentration of extracellular adenosine leading to the activation of A1 receptors (at adenosine-sensitive parallel fibre synapses) and the suppression of glutamate release. It would be predicted that the synapses that were insensitive to adenosine would be less depressed by hypoxia and thus maintain function during metabolic stress. However those synapses which were insensitive to adenosine were rapidly inhibited by hypoxia via a mechanism which was not reversed by blocking A1 receptors. Thus another mechanism must be responsible for the hypoxia-mediated depression at these synapses. These different mechanisms of depression may be important for cell survival and for maintenance of cerebellar function following oxygen starvation.",0.02474502409034629,7376847,Excitotoxic ATP and Glutamate Signalling during Central Nervous System Ischaemia,"Neural cell death plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of various ischaemic disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), most prominently stroke, causing very significant mortality and morbidity. Severe ischaemia rapidly kills both neurons and astrocytes, two CNS cell types whose interactions are essential to normal brain functioning, so ideally a target needs to be found which will protect both. Glutamate mediated excitotoxicity, the process whereby excessive extracellular glutamate causes cell death via the over-activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors, is known to operate during ischaemia.
However, there is increasing evidence that ATP mediated excitotoxicity may also occur.  Using an in vitro model of ischaemia (oxygen-glucose deprivation: OGD) and various murine primary cortical cell cultures, I investigated the hypothesis that parallel pathways of ATP and glutamate mediated excitotoxicity contribute to the death of both astrocytes and neurons during ischaemia. OGD produced rapid and significant ATP and glutamate release from co-cultures of astrocytes and neurons, as measured using microelectrode biosensors. Glutamate release was mainly from astrocytes, whereas the cellular origin of ATP was less clear. Ca2+ imaging of Fura-2 loaded cells confirmed functional P2 receptor expression in all astrocytes and 60% of neurons along with glutamate receptor expression in all neurons but only a small proportion of astrocytes. During OGD, blocking NMDA and AMPA/kainate receptors significantly reduced neuronal death, while non-selective P2 receptor antagonists as well as selective P2Y1 (but not P2X7) receptor antagonists prevented the death of both neurons and astrocytes. Furthermore, a synergistic protective effect was produced by combining low concentrations of P2 and glutamate receptor antagonists, reducing cell death to control levels. These results suggest that ATP and glutamate, acting at P2 and ionotropic glutamate receptors, are the main mediators of early cell death during severe CNS ischaemia, and thus represent a potential target for powerful neuroprotective strategies.",0.025173788528497054,99719,Opposing Changes in Phosphorylation of Specific Sites in Synapsin I During Ca2-Dependent Glutamate Release in Isolated Nerve Terminals,"Synapsins are major neuronal phosphoproteins involved in regulation
of neurotransmitter release. Synapsins are well established
targets for multiple protein kinases within the nerve
terminal, yet little is known about dephosphorylation processes
involved in regulation of synapsin function. Here, we observed
a reciprocal relationship in the phosphorylation–dephosphorylation
of the established phosphorylation sites on synapsin I.
We demonstrate that, in vitro, phosphorylation sites 1, 2, and 3
of synapsin I (P-site 1 phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent
protein kinase; P-sites 2 and 3 phosphorylated by Ca2–
calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) were excellent substrates
for protein phosphatase 2A, whereas P-sites 4, 5, and 6 (phosphorylated
by mitogen-activated protein kinase) were efficiently
dephosphorylated only by Ca2–calmodulin-dependent protein
phosphatase 2B–calcineurin. In isolated nerve terminals, rapid
changes in synapsin I phosphorylation were observed after Ca2
entry, namely, a Ca2-dependent phosphorylation of P-sites 1, 2,
and 3 and a Ca2-dependent dephosphorylation of P-sites 4, 5,
and 6. Inhibition of calcineurin activity by cyclosporin A resulted in
a complete block of Ca2-dependent dephosphorylation of
P-sites 4, 5, and 6 and correlated with a prominent increase in
ionomycin-evoked glutamate release. These two opposing, rapid,
Ca2-dependent processes may play a crucial role in the modulation
of synaptic vesicle trafficking within the presynaptic terminal.",0.02666202796248307,2809487,cAMP responsive element-binding protein phosphorylation is necessary for perirhinal long-term potentiation and recognition memory,"We established the importance of phosphorylation of cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB) to both the familiarity discrimination component of long-term recognition memory and plasticity within the perirhinal cortex of the temporal lobe. Adenoviral transduction of perirhinal cortex (and adjacent visual association cortex) with a dominant-negative inhibitor of CREB impaired the preferential exploration of novel over familiar objects at a long (24 h) but not a short (15 min) delay, disrupted the normal reduced activation of perirhinal neurons to familiar compared with novel pictures, and impaired long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission in perirhinal slices. The consistency of these effects across the behavioral, systems, and cellular levels of analysis provides strong evidence for involvement of CREB phosphorylation in synaptic plastic processes within perirhinal cortex necessary for long-term recognition memory.",0.02897127541184663

To validate the technique, tests were performed using a suite of standard gases, composed of CO2 and CH4 of distinctly different isotopic composition. We employed the method to investigate the carbon isotopic composition of samples of dissolved CO2 and CH4 collected in situ from the near surface to deep layers of an ombrotrophic raised peat bog. Results showed that the age of both the CO2 and CH4 components of the dissolved gases increased with depth from ~ 0–300 BP at 0.25 m to ~ 4000 BP at 4 m. CH4 was mainly similar or slightly older in age compared to CO2, with the greatest difference in ages occurring at 1 m depth where CH4 was older by 430-615 years. The &#948;13C values of CO2 increased with depth from -12.4 ‰ and -8.0 ‰ at 0.25 m to +6.9 ‰ and +8.3 ‰ at 4 m, whereas the &#948;13C of CH4 stayed in the range -58.4 ‰ to -70.6 ‰. The 14C results from the deepest layers are consistent with a similar source for both gases. 14C ages for the CO2 component were younger compared to CH4, within the shallower depths of the peat bog (&#8804; 1 m) and demonstrate the incorporation of acrotelm-derived respired CO2 into the catotelm.",6159054,Isotopes in pyrogenic carbon: a review,"Pyrogenic carbon (PC; also known as biochar, charcoal, black carbon and soot) derived from natural and anthropogenic burning plays a major, but poorly quantified, role in the global carbon cycle. Isotopes provide a fundamental fingerprint of the source of PC and a powerful tracer of interactions between PC and the environment. Radiocarbon and stable carbon isotope techniques have been widely applied to studies of PC in aerosols, soils, sediments and archaeological sequences, with the use of other isotopes currently less developed. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge regarding (i) techniques for isolating PC for isotope analysis and (ii) processes controlling the carbon (13C and 14C), nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen and sulfur isotope composition of PC during formation and after deposition. It also reviews the current and potential future applications of isotope based studies to better understand the role of PC in the modern environment and to the development of records of past environmental change.",0.02869922723677798,120965,The performance of cement stabilised minestone,"This study is concerned with the durability of cement stabilised minestone (CSM). Minestone is dominated by the clay-bearing mudrocks and shales of the Coal Measures. Consequently, engineering problems are often encountered due to the likelihood of these rocks undergoing volume change and degradation when exposed to fluctuations in moisture content. In addition, iron sulphides (chiefly pyrite) are frequently present in minestone as diagenetic minerals which on excavation have the potential to oxidise forming sulphate minerals. The oxidation of sulphides may in itself contribute to volume increase in pyritic rocks and sulphate minerals may combine with the products of cement hydration to produce further expansion. The physical and chemical properties of a wide range of minestones are determined and attempts are made to correlate these with the engineering performance of cement stabilised specimens subjected to short-term immersion in water. Criteria, based on these raw material indices are proposed with a view to eliminating minestones which are unsuitable. A long-term durability study is also described. In this, the geochemical stability of pyrite in CSM was examined together with the role played by the sulphur bearing mineralogy in determining the engineering performance of CSM's exposed to conditions of increased moisture availability. The nature of a number of disrupted CSM pavements which have been examined are also discussed.",0.03577394207746831,224399,Investigations of suction caissons in dense sand,"Offshore structures are used in a variety of applications ranging from the traditional oil and gas extraction facilities to emerging renewable energy concepts. These structures must be secured to the seabed in an efficient and cost effective manner. A novel approach is to use shallow inverted buckets as foundations, installed by suction, in place of the more usual piles. These foundations lead to cost savings through reduction in materials and in time required for installation. It is necessary to determine how these foundations perform under typical offshore loading conditions so that design calculations may be developed. This thesis presents experimental data from a comprehensive series of investigations aimed at determining the important mechanisms to consider in the design of these shallow foundations for dense sand. 

Initially the long term loading behaviour (e.g. wind and current) was investigated by conducting three degree of freedom loading {V:M/2R:H} tests on a foundation embedded in dry sand. The results were interpreted through existing work-hardening plasticity theories. The analysis of the data has suggested a number of improved modelling features. Cyclic and transient tests, representing wave loading, were carried out on a foundation embedded in an oil saturated sand. The novel feature of the cyclic loading was that a 'pseudo-random' load history (based on the 'NewWave' theory) was used to represent realistic loading paths. Of particular interest was the tensile load capacity of the foundation. The results observed suggested that for tensile loading serviceability requirements rather than capacity may govern design. Under combined-load cyclic conditions the results indicated that conventional plasticity theory would not provide a sufficient description of response. A new theory, termed 'continuous hyperplasticity' was used, reproducing the results with impressive accuracy. Surprisingly, under the conditions investigated, loading rate was found to have a negligible effect on response.",0.03985356766459025,1621177,Recent advances in computational fluid dynamics relevant to the modelling of pesticide flow on leaf surfaces,"Increasing societal and governmental concern about the worldwide use of chemical pesticides is now providing strong drivers towards maximising the efficiency of pesticide utilisation and the development of alternative control techniques. There is growing recognition that the ultimate goal of achieving efficient and sustainable pesticide usage will require greater understanding of the fluid mechanical mechanisms governing the delivery to, and spreading of, pesticide droplets on target surfaces such as leaves. This has led to increasing use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) as an important component of efficient process design with regard to pesticide delivery to the leaf surface. This perspective highlights recent advances in CFD methods for droplet spreading and film flows, which have the potential to provide accurate, predictive models for pesticide flow on leaf surfaces, and which can take account of each of the key influences of surface topography and chemistry, initial spray deposition conditions, evaporation and multiple droplet spreading interactions. The mathematical framework of these CFD methods is described briefly, and a series of new flow simulation results relevant to pesticide flows over foliage is provided. The potential benefits of employing CFD for practical process design are also discussed briefly.",0.040053047096706096,9050391,Soil Limitations to Agrarian Land Production in Premodern Iceland,"Early arable activity in Iceland, introduced in the late ninth century A.D., has
been characterized as marginal and at a subsistence level, largely abandoned by
the 1500s as a result of climatic deterioration. This view has been advanced
without considering soils data, the medium in which crops are grown and in which
evidence of early land management is retained. Soil thin section micromorphology
together with soil total phosphorus values are used to assess land manuring and
cultivation strategies at two sites in south-west Iceland, where place name and
palynological evidence indicate that arable activity has taken place. Agro-
ecosystem modeling, using the CENTURY model, is undertaken to predict grain
yields at these sites, and to assess the significance of soil properties and
soil management in determining yields. The results of these analyses demonstrate
that manure application rates were low, and support the view that grain yields
were at a subsistence level. The results also suggest soils, and the management
of soils, rather than climate was the major limitation to arable production.
Shortages of both available manure and labor are suggested as barriers to soils
and grain productivity improvements in early Iceland. The paper highlights the
need to include soils analyses in discussions of early agricultural economies.",0.04060527052759633
