They were initially conceived for image categorization,i.e., the problem of assigning a semantic label to an entire input image.  In this paper we address the problem of dense semantic labeling, whichconsists in assigning a semantic label to every pixel in an image. Since thisrequires a high spatial accuracy to determine where labels are assigned,categorization CNNs, intended to be highly robust to local deformations, arenot directly applicable.  By adapting categorization networks, many semantic labeling CNNs have beenrecently proposed. Our first contribution is an in-depth analysis of thesearchitectures. We establish the desired properties of an ideal semanticlabeling CNN, and assess how those methods stand with regard to theseproperties. We observe that even though they provide competitive results, theseCNNs often underexploit properties of semantic labeling that could lead to moreeffective and efficient architectures.  Out of these observations, we then derive a CNN framework specificallyadapted to the semantic labeling problem. In addition to learning features atdifferent resolutions, it learns how to combine these features. By integratinglocal and global information in an efficient and flexible manner, itoutperforms previous techniques. We evaluate the proposed framework and compareit with state-of-the-art architectures on public benchmarks of high-resolutionaerial image labeling.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01962v1,High-Resolution Semantic Labeling with Convolutional Neural Networks,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have received increasing attention overthe last few years.

An area of special interest for such 3D reconstructionsis the cultural heritage domain, where surface reconstructions are generated todigitally preserve historical artifacts. While reconstruction quality nowadaysis sufficient in many cases, the robust analysis (e.g. segmentation, matching,and classification) of reconstructed 3D data is still an open topic. In thispaper, we target the automatic and interactive segmentation of high-resolution3D surface reconstructions from the archaeological domain. To foster researchin this field, we introduce a fully annotated and publicly availablelarge-scale 3D surface dataset including high-resolution meshes, depth maps andpoint clouds as a novel benchmark dataset to the community. We provide baselineresults for our existing random forest-based approach and for the first timeinvestigate segmentation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on the data.Results show that both approaches have complementary strengths and weaknessesand that the provided dataset represents a challenge for future research.",archaeology,0.01573769196218322,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01290v1,Relational Reasoning using Prior Knowledge for Visual Captioning,"Exploiting relationships among objects has achieved remarkable progress ininterpreting images or videos by natural language. Most existing methods resortto first detecting objects and their relationships, and then generating textualdescriptions, which heavily depends on pre-trained detectors and leads toperformance drop when facing problems of heavy occlusion, tiny-size objects andlong-tail in object detection. In addition, the separate procedure of detectingand captioning results in semantic inconsistency between the pre-definedobject/relation categories and the target lexical words. We exploit prior humancommonsense knowledge for reasoning relationships between objects without anypre-trained detectors and reaching semantic coherency within one image or videoin captioning. The prior knowledge (e.g., in the form of knowledge graph)provides commonsense semantic correlation and constraint between objects thatare not explicit in the image and video, serving as useful guidance to buildsemantic graph for sentence generation. Particularly, we present a jointreasoning method that incorporates 1) commonsense reasoning for embedding imageor video regions into semantic space to build semantic graph and 2) relationalreasoning for encoding semantic graph to generate sentences. Extensiveexperiments on the MS-COCO image captioning benchmark and the MSVD videocaptioning benchmark validate the superiority of our method on leveraging priorcommonsense knowledge to enhance relational reasoning for visual captioning.",semantics,0.01720484776304787,http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06067v1,Dynamic-structured Semantic Propagation Network,"Semantic concept hierarchy is still under-explored for semantic segmentationdue to the inefficiency and complicated optimization of incorporatingstructural inference into dense prediction. This lack of modeling semanticcorrelations also makes prior works must tune highly-specified models for eachtask due to the label discrepancy across datasets. It severely limits thegeneralization capability of segmentation models for open set conceptvocabulary and annotation utilization. In this paper, we propose aDynamic-Structured Semantic Propagation Network (DSSPN) that builds a semanticneuron graph by explicitly incorporating the semantic concept hierarchy intonetwork construction. Each neuron represents the instantiated module forrecognizing a specific type of entity such as a super-class (e.g. food) or aspecific concept (e.g. pizza). During training, DSSPN performs thedynamic-structured neuron computation graph by only activating a sub-graph ofneurons for each image in a principled way. A dense semantic-enhanced neuralblock is proposed to propagate the learned knowledge of all ancestor neuronsinto each fine-grained child neuron for feature evolving. Another merit of suchsemantic explainable structure is the ability of learning a unified modelconcurrently on diverse datasets by selectively activating different neuronsub-graphs for each annotation at each step. Extensive experiments on fourpublic semantic segmentation datasets (i.e. ADE20K, COCO-Stuff, Cityscape andMapillary) demonstrate the superiority of our DSSPN over state-of-the-artsegmentation models. Moreoever, we demonstrate a universal segmentation modelthat is jointly trained on diverse datasets can surpass the performance of thecommon fine-tuning scheme for exploiting multiple domain knowledge.",semantics,0.018573322061708586,http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13282v1,"Medusa: A C++ Library for solving PDEs using Strong Form Mesh-Free
  methods","Medusa, a novel library for implementation of strong form mesh-free methods,is described. We identify and present common parts and patterns among many suchmethods reported in the literature, such as node positioning, stencil selectionand stencil weight computation. Many different algorithms exist for each partand the possible combinations offer a plethora of possibilities forimprovements of solution procedures that are far from fully understood. As aconsequence there are still many unanswered questions in mesh-free communityresulting in vivid ongoing research in the field. Medusa implements the coremesh-free elements as independent blocks, which offers users great flexibilityin experimenting with the method they are developing, as well as easilycomparing it with other existing methods.
