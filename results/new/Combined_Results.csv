  Semantic Correlations","Multi-label learning has attracted significant interests in computer visionrecently, finding applications in many vision tasks such as multiple objectrecognition and automatic image annotation. Associating multiple labels to acomplex image is very difficult, not only due to the intricacy of describingthe image, but also because of the incompleteness nature of the observedlabels. Existing works on the problem either ignore the label-label andinstance-instance correlations or just assume these correlations are linear andunstructured. Considering that semantic correlations between images areactually structured, in this paper we propose to incorporate structuredsemantic correlations to solve the missing label problem of multi-labellearning. Specifically, we project images to the semantic space with aneffective semantic descriptor. A semantic graph is then constructed on theseimages to capture the structured correlations between them. We utilize thesemantic graph Laplacian as a smooth term in the multi-label learningformulation to incorporate the structured semantic correlations. Experimentalresults demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed semantic descriptor andthe usefulness of incorporating the structured semantic correlations.

Accordingly, ourapproach is the first to provide a semantically labeled dense reconstruction ofthe environment from a stream of RGB-D images.

Intuitively thisproblem can be approached using standard methods and architectures. However, abetter-suited approach is needed to avoid generating blurry, hallucinated andthus unusable images since tasks like semantic segmentation require pixel-levelexactness. In this work, we present a novel architecture for learning togenerate pixel-level accurate semantic images, namely Semantic GenerativeAdversarial Networks (SemGANs).

  First-Millennium BCE Levantine Ivory Carving: A Machine Learning Approach","Thousands of first-millennium BCE ivory carvings have been excavated fromNeo-Assyrian sites in Mesopotamia (primarily Nimrud, Khorsabad, and ArslanTash) hundreds of miles from their Levantine production contexts. At present,their specific manufacture dates and workshop localities are unknown. Relyingon subjective, visual methods, scholars have grappled with their classificationand regional attribution for over a century. This study combines visualapproaches with machine-learning techniques to offer data-driven perspectiveson the classification and attribution of this early Iron Age corpus. The studysample consisted of 162 sculptures of female figures. We have developed analgorithm that clusters the ivories based on a combination of descriptive andanthropometric data. The resulting categories, which are based on purelystatistical criteria, show good agreement with conventional art historicalclassifications, while revealing new perspectives, especially with regard tothe contested Syrian/South Syrian/Intermediate tradition. Specifically, we haveidentified that objects of the Syrian/South Syrian/Intermediate tradition maybe more closely related to Phoenician objects than to North Syrian objects; weoffer a reconsideration of a subset of Phoenician objects, and we confirmSyrian/South Syrian/Intermediate stylistic subgroups that might distinguishnetworks of acquisition among the sites of Nimrud, Khorsabad, Arslan Tash andthe Levant. We have also identified which features are most significant in ourcluster assignments and might thereby be most diagnostic of regional carvingtraditions. In short, our study both corroborates traditional visualclassification methods and demonstrates how machine-learning techniques may beemployed to reveal complementary information not accessible through theexclusively visual analysis of an archaeological corpus.",0.3753734230995178,http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2537v2,Analysis of communities in a mythological social network,"The intriguing nature of classical Homeric narratives has always fascinatedthe occidental culture contributing to philosophy, history, mythology andstraight forwardly to literature.

Secondly we may perceive a biased aspect of itsstories contents, varying from real-historical to fictional-mythological. Toencompass this glance, there are some new archeological finding that supportshistoricity of some events described within Iliad, and consequently to Odyssey.Considering these observations and using complex network theory concepts, wemanaged to built and analyze a social network gathered across the classicalepic, Odyssey of Homer. Longing for further understanding, topologicalquantities were collected in order to classify its social network qualitativelyinto real or fictional. It turns out that most of the found properties belongto real social networks besides assortativity and giant component's size. Inorder to test the network's possibilities to be real, we removed somemythological members that could imprint a fictional aspect on the network.Carrying on this maneuver the modified social network resulted on assortativemixing and reduction of the giant component, as expected for real socialnetworks. Overall we observe that Odyssey might be an amalgam of fictionalelements plus real based human relations, which corroborates other author'sfindings for Iliad and archeological evidences.",0.458696186542511,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0702024v1,Optica Precolombina Del Peru,"Archaeological American mirrors are common findings and the images obtainedwith them are often described by archaeologists as possessing high quality.However, photographs attesting this fact are rare, if any.

In addition, the separate procedure of detectingand captioning results in semantic inconsistency between the pre-definedobject/relation categories and the target lexical words. We exploit prior humancommonsense knowledge for reasoning relationships between objects without anypre-trained detectors and reaching semantic coherency within one image or videoin captioning. The prior knowledge (e.g., in the form of knowledge graph)provides commonsense semantic correlation and constraint between objects thatare not explicit in the image and video, serving as useful guidance to buildsemantic graph for sentence generation. Particularly, we present a jointreasoning method that incorporates 1) commonsense reasoning for embedding imageor video regions into semantic space to build semantic graph and 2) relationalreasoning for encoding semantic graph to generate sentences.

This lack of modeling semanticcorrelations also makes prior works must tune highly-specified models for eachtask due to the label discrepancy across datasets. It severely limits thegeneralization capability of segmentation models for open set conceptvocabulary and annotation utilization. In this paper, we propose aDynamic-Structured Semantic Propagation Network (DSSPN) that builds a semanticneuron graph by explicitly incorporating the semantic concept hierarchy intonetwork construction. Each neuron represents the instantiated module forrecognizing a specific type of entity such as a super-class (e.g. food) or aspecific concept (e.g. pizza). During training, DSSPN performs thedynamic-structured neuron computation graph by only activating a sub-graph ofneurons for each image in a principled way. A dense semantic-enhanced neuralblock is proposed to propagate the learned knowledge of all ancestor neuronsinto each fine-grained child neuron for feature evolving. Another merit of suchsemantic explainable structure is the ability of learning a unified modelconcurrently on diverse datasets by selectively activating different neuronsub-graphs for each annotation at each step. Extensive experiments on fourpublic semantic segmentation datasets (i.e. ADE20K, COCO-Stuff, Cityscape andMapillary) demonstrate the superiority of our DSSPN over state-of-the-artsegmentation models.
