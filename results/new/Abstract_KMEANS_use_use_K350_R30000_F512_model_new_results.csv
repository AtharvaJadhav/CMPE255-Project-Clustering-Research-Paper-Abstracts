They were initially conceived for image categorization,i.e., the problem of assigning a semantic label to an entire input image.  In this paper we address the problem of dense semantic labeling, whichconsists in assigning a semantic label to every pixel in an image. Since thisrequires a high spatial accuracy to determine where labels are assigned,categorization CNNs, intended to be highly robust to local deformations, arenot directly applicable.  By adapting categorization networks, many semantic labeling CNNs have beenrecently proposed. Our first contribution is an in-depth analysis of thesearchitectures. We establish the desired properties of an ideal semanticlabeling CNN, and assess how those methods stand with regard to theseproperties. We observe that even though they provide competitive results, theseCNNs often underexploit properties of semantic labeling that could lead to moreeffective and efficient architectures.  Out of these observations, we then derive a CNN framework specificallyadapted to the semantic labeling problem. In addition to learning features atdifferent resolutions, it learns how to combine these features. By integratinglocal and global information in an efficient and flexible manner, itoutperforms previous techniques.

  Labeling","Recent approaches for instance-aware semantic labeling have augmentedconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) with complex multi-task architectures orcomputationally expensive graphical models. We present a method that leveragesa fully convolutional network (FCN) to predict semantic labels, depth and aninstance-based encoding using each pixel's direction towards its correspondinginstance center. Subsequently, we apply low-level computer vision techniques togenerate state-of-the-art instance segmentation on the street scene datasetsKITTI and Cityscapes. Our approach outperforms existing works by a large marginand can additionally predict absolute distances of individual instances from amonocular image as well as a pixel-level semantic labeling.",0.2585293650627136,http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01441v1,"Improving Multi-label Learning with Missing Labels by Structured
  Semantic Correlations","Multi-label learning has attracted significant interests in computer visionrecently, finding applications in many vision tasks such as multiple objectrecognition and automatic image annotation. Associating multiple labels to acomplex image is very difficult, not only due to the intricacy of describingthe image, but also because of the incompleteness nature of the observedlabels. Existing works on the problem either ignore the label-label andinstance-instance correlations or just assume these correlations are linear andunstructured. Considering that semantic correlations between images areactually structured, in this paper we propose to incorporate structuredsemantic correlations to solve the missing label problem of multi-labellearning. Specifically, we project images to the semantic space with aneffective semantic descriptor. A semantic graph is then constructed on theseimages to capture the structured correlations between them. We utilize thesemantic graph Laplacian as a smooth term in the multi-label learningformulation to incorporate the structured semantic correlations. Experimentalresults demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed semantic descriptor andthe usefulness of incorporating the structured semantic correlations. Weachieve better results than state-of-the-art multi-label learning methods onfour benchmark datasets.",0.2910867929458618,http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04242v1,Volume-based Semantic Labeling with Signed Distance Functions,"Research works on the two topics of Semantic Segmentation and SLAM(Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) have been following separate tracks.Here, we link them quite tightly by delineating a category label fusiontechnique that allows for embedding semantic information into the dense mapcreated by a volume-based SLAM algorithm such as KinectFusion. Accordingly, ourapproach is the first to provide a semantically labeled dense reconstruction ofthe environment from a stream of RGB-D images. We validate our proposal using apublicly available semantically annotated RGB-D dataset and a) employing groundtruth labels, b) corrupting such annotations with synthetic noise, c) deployinga state of the art semantic segmentation algorithm based on ConvolutionalNeural Networks.",0.30172187089920044,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.12195v1,Adversarial Pixel-Level Generation of Semantic Images,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have obtained extraordinary success inthe generation of realistic images, a domain where a lower pixel-level accuracyis acceptable. We study the problem, not yet tackled in the literature, ofgenerating semantic images starting from a prior distribution. Intuitively thisproblem can be approached using standard methods and architectures. However, abetter-suited approach is needed to avoid generating blurry, hallucinated andthus unusable images since tasks like semantic segmentation require pixel-levelexactness. In this work, we present a novel architecture for learning togenerate pixel-level accurate semantic images, namely Semantic GenerativeAdversarial Networks (SemGANs). The experimental evaluation shows that ourarchitecture outperforms standard ones from both a quantitative and aqualitative point of view in many semantic image generation tasks.",0.3037557005882263

  First-Millennium BCE Levantine Ivory Carving: A Machine Learning Approach","Thousands of first-millennium BCE ivory carvings have been excavated fromNeo-Assyrian sites in Mesopotamia (primarily Nimrud, Khorsabad, and ArslanTash) hundreds of miles from their Levantine production contexts. At present,their specific manufacture dates and workshop localities are unknown. Relyingon subjective, visual methods, scholars have grappled with their classificationand regional attribution for over a century. This study combines visualapproaches with machine-learning techniques to offer data-driven perspectiveson the classification and attribution of this early Iron Age corpus. The studysample consisted of 162 sculptures of female figures. We have developed analgorithm that clusters the ivories based on a combination of descriptive andanthropometric data. The resulting categories, which are based on purelystatistical criteria, show good agreement with conventional art historicalclassifications, while revealing new perspectives, especially with regard tothe contested Syrian/South Syrian/Intermediate tradition. Specifically, we haveidentified that objects of the Syrian/South Syrian/Intermediate tradition maybe more closely related to Phoenician objects than to North Syrian objects; weoffer a reconsideration of a subset of Phoenician objects, and we confirmSyrian/South Syrian/Intermediate stylistic subgroups that might distinguishnetworks of acquisition among the sites of Nimrud, Khorsabad, Arslan Tash andthe Levant. We have also identified which features are most significant in ourcluster assignments and might thereby be most diagnostic of regional carvingtraditions. In short, our study both corroborates traditional visualclassification methods and demonstrates how machine-learning techniques may beemployed to reveal complementary information not accessible through theexclusively visual analysis of an archaeological corpus.",0.3753734230995178,http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2537v2,Analysis of communities in a mythological social network,"The intriguing nature of classical Homeric narratives has always fascinatedthe occidental culture contributing to philosophy, history, mythology andstraight forwardly to literature. However what would be so intriguing aboutHomer's narratives' At a first gaze we shall recognize the very literal appealand aesthetic pleasure presented on every page across Homer's chants in Odysseyand rhapsodies in Iliad. Secondly we may perceive a biased aspect of itsstories contents, varying from real-historical to fictional-mythological. Toencompass this glance, there are some new archeological finding that supportshistoricity of some events described within Iliad, and consequently to Odyssey.Considering these observations and using complex network theory concepts, wemanaged to built and analyze a social network gathered across the classicalepic, Odyssey of Homer. Longing for further understanding, topologicalquantities were collected in order to classify its social network qualitativelyinto real or fictional. It turns out that most of the found properties belongto real social networks besides assortativity and giant component's size. Inorder to test the network's possibilities to be real, we removed somemythological members that could imprint a fictional aspect on the network.Carrying on this maneuver the modified social network resulted on assortativemixing and reduction of the giant component, as expected for real socialnetworks. Overall we observe that Odyssey might be an amalgam of fictionalelements plus real based human relations, which corroborates other author'sfindings for Iliad and archeological evidences.",0.458696186542511,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0702024v1,Optica Precolombina Del Peru,"Archaeological American mirrors are common findings and the images obtainedwith them are often described by archaeologists as possessing high quality.However, photographs attesting this fact are rare, if any.
