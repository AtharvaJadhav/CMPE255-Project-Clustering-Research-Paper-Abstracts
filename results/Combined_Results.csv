0,0,9632495,Intracellular mechanisms underlying the nicotinic enhancement of LTP in the rat dentate gyrus,"We have previously shown that activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the rat dentate gyrus in vitro via activation of α7 nAChR. In the present studies, mechanisms underlying the acute and chronic nicotinic enhancement of LTP were examined. In particular, the involvement of activation of intracellular kinases was examined using selective kinase antagonists, and the effects of enhancing cholinergic function with positive allosteric modulators of the α7 nAChR and with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors were also investigated. Activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) was found to be involved in the induction of the acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP, although not control LTP. In contrast, activation of the tyrosine kinase Src, Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, Janus kinase 2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase was not involved in the acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP, although Src activation was necessary for control LTP. Moreover, activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase was involved in the acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP to a much lesser extent than in control LTP. Chronic nicotine enhancement of LTP was found to be dependent on PKA, ERK and Src kinases. Acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP was occluded by chronic nicotine treatment.

This phenomenon, known as pharmacological preconditioning, decreases infarct size and increases the functional recovery of the intact heart. The role of protein kinases and ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP) in phenylephrine preconditioning was investigated in isolated ventricular myocytes using whole cell patch clamp, western blotting, fluorescence imaging and measurement of contractile activity. The role of PKC isoforms was examined using isoform-specific PKC activator and inhibitor peptides.
Preconditioning with phenylephrine increased the contractile recovery of isolated ventricular myocytes following simulated ischaemia and reperfusion, and this was also correlated with an improvement in calcium homeostasis during reperfusion. The protective effect of phenylephrine preconditioning on contractile recovery was abolished by inhibition of α1-adrenoceptors, PKC or KATP. We observed a sustained activation of PKCε and δ in response to phenylephrine preconditioning, and identified a protective role for PKCε. PKCδ was required for phenylephrine preconditioning but also increased reperfusion injury. CaMKK, AMPK and p38 MAPK were all required for phenylephrine preconditioning, and activation of AMPK by phenylephrine preconditioning required PKCδ. However, both JNK and ERK appear not to be involved in the protective effect.
Inhibition of sarcolemmal KATP channels (sarcKATP) or mitochondrial KATP channels (mitoKATP) prevented preconditioning. Peak sarcKATP current activated by metabolic inhibition was increased following phenylephrine preconditioning and inhibition of PKCδ, AMPK or p38 MAPK was sufficient to prevent the increase in current.
Increased sarcKATP current can enhance hyperpolarisation of the resting membrane potential, and may be responsible for the observed decrease in calcium loading and improved contractile recovery of phenylephrine preconditioned ventricular myocytes following ischaemia and reperfusion.",0.04290554239482358,99719,Opposing Changes in Phosphorylation of Specific Sites in Synapsin I During Ca2-Dependent Glutamate Release in Isolated Nerve Terminals,"Synapsins are major neuronal phosphoproteins involved in regulation
of neurotransmitter release. Synapsins are well established

a reciprocal relationship in the phosphorylation–dephosphorylation

We demonstrate that, in vitro, phosphorylation sites 1, 2, and 3
of synapsin I (P-site 1 phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent
protein kinase; P-sites 2 and 3 phosphorylated by Ca2–
calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) were excellent substrates
for protein phosphatase 2A, whereas P-sites 4, 5, and 6 (phosphorylated
by mitogen-activated protein kinase) were efficiently
dephosphorylated only by Ca2–calmodulin-dependent protein

changes in synapsin I phosphorylation were observed after Ca2

Incubation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with the 5-HT\(_3\) receptor agonist DDP733 and the positive allosteric modulator 5-chloroindole increased the percentage of CD25+FoxP3+ lymphoyctes (Treg phenotype). Proliferation of PBMC was inhibited by DDP733 plus 5-chloroindole indicating functional impact by the 5-HT\(_3\) receptor. The GPR55 receptor was also expressed by human T cells. The GPR55 agonist lysophosphatidylinositol increased cell viability by preventing apoptosis. However, the induced response was not blocked by the GPR55 receptor antagonist cannabidiol casting doubt over the GPR55 receptor mediating the response. Cannabidiol was demonstrated to have a pro-apoptotic effect in its own right, although whether this effect is mediated by GPR55 or the CB2 cannabinoid receptor is unknown. Further experiments are required to elucidate the role of the 5-HT\(_3\)A receptor in lymphocyte function and the mechanism responsible for the immunoprotective role of lysophosphatidylinositol.",0.04728287095946149,19265,The novel Syk inhibitor R406 reveals mechanistic differences in the initiation of GPVI and CLEC-2 signaling in platelets,"Background: Syk is a key mediator of signaling pathways downstream of several platelet surface receptors including GPVI/FcRc collagen receptor, the C-type lectin receptor CLEC-2, and integrin aIIbb3. A recent study identified the novel small molecule R406 as a selective inhibitor of Syk. Objectives: The present study evaluates the role of Syk in human platelets using the novel inhibitor R406. Methods: Agonist-induced GPVI and CLEC-2 signaling were assessed using aggregometry, immunoprecipitation and western blotting to determine the effects of R406 on platelet activation. Results: We demonstrate R406 to be a powerful inhibitor of Syk in human platelets. R406 abrogated shape change and aggregation induced by activation of GPVI and CLEC-2, and reduced platelet spreading on fibrinogen. The inhibitory effect of R406 was associated with inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling proteins that lay downstream of Syk for all three receptors, including PLCc2.Strikingly, R406 markedly inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of CLEC-2 and Syk downstream of CLEC-2 activation,whereas phosphorylation of Syk downstream of GPVI and integrin aIIbb3 was unaffected. Conclusions: The inhibitory effect of R406 provides direct evidence of a role for Syk in GPVI, CLEC-2 and integrin aIIbb3 signaling in human platelets. Further, the results demonstrate a critical role for Syk in mediating tyrosine phosphorylation of CLEC-2,suggesting a novel model in which both Src and Syk kinases mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of the C-type lectin receptor leading to platelet activation.",0.04860603445072742,fasttext,normalmean

To validate the technique, tests were performed using a suite of standard gases, composed of CO2 and CH4 of distinctly different isotopic composition. We employed the method to investigate the carbon isotopic composition of samples of dissolved CO2 and CH4 collected in situ from the near surface to deep layers of an ombrotrophic raised peat bog. Results showed that the age of both the CO2 and CH4 components of the dissolved gases increased with depth from ~ 0–300 BP at 0.25 m to ~ 4000 BP at 4 m. CH4 was mainly similar or slightly older in age compared to CO2, with the greatest difference in ages occurring at 1 m depth where CH4 was older by 430-615 years. The &#948;13C values of CO2 increased with depth from -12.4 ‰ and -8.0 ‰ at 0.25 m to +6.9 ‰ and +8.3 ‰ at 4 m, whereas the &#948;13C of CH4 stayed in the range -58.4 ‰ to -70.6 ‰. The 14C results from the deepest layers are consistent with a similar source for both gases. 14C ages for the CO2 component were younger compared to CH4, within the shallower depths of the peat bog (&#8804; 1 m) and demonstrate the incorporation of acrotelm-derived respired CO2 into the catotelm.",1395050,"HREM studies of intergrowths in Sr<sub>2</sub>[Sr<sub>n</sub><sub>-</sub><sub>1</sub>Ti<sub>n</sub>O<sub>3n</sub><sub>+</sub><sub>1</sub>] Ruddlesden-Popper

a single ordered Sr3Ti2O7 structure is dominant in the sample corresponding to n=2, a few intergrowths of other Ruddlesden–Popper phases were
observed. In the cases of n=3 and 4, the intergrowths of Ruddlesden–Popper phases are more frequent than in the n=2 composition and are

Both agonists have also been demonstrated to stimulate proliferation, neogenesis and increased transcription potentially thourough ERK1/2 dependent pathways. ERK1/2 has been shown to play an important role in regulating pancreatic β-cell function and mass and mediating gene transcription. Therefore, this thesis aims to elucidate the mechanism by which GLP-1, via the GLP-1R, and carbachol, via Gq-coupled mAChR activation, leads to the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in the pancreatic β-cell line MIN6.
I demonstrate that both GLP-1R and mAChR stimulation mediate Ca2+-dependent ERK1/2 activation requiring the activation of the L-type VGCC. 
GLP-1 causes a sustained activation of ERK1/2 that requires continual activation of the L-type VGCC and the sustained elevation of local Ca2+ around the mouth of the channel. Importantly, ERK1/2 activation stimulated by L-type VGCCs mediated Ca2+ influx is required for GLP-1 stimulated insulin transcription. The mechanism by which the L-type VGCC signals to ERK1/2 was also investigated. I demonstrate that L-type VGCC-dependent ERK1/2 activation mediated by local Ca2+ is Ras-independent. However, a global rise in Ca2+ mediated by a depolarising stimulus is capable of mediating ERK1/2 activation by a Ras-dependent mechanism. I have also demonstrated that the down-regulation of DAG-sensitive proteins significantly inhibits GLP-1 stimulated ERK1/2 activation, but this is not thourough the down regulation or inactivation of classical or novel PKC isoforms.
 mAChR activation mediates the rapid and transient phosphorylation of ERK1/2 which is dependent upon PLC and a rise in [Ca2+]i, but independent of PKC activation. Importantly, the rise in [Ca2+]i is mediated from multiple sources including: the efflux of Ca2+ from the ER by IP3R activation, the influx of extracellular Ca2+ thourough store operated channels (SOC) and L-type VGCC activation. I provide evidence that the activation of the L-type VGCC is partially mediated by the inhibition of KATP channels via PIP2 depletion, as increasing PIP2 levels partially inhibits carbachol-stimulated increases in [Ca2+]i and ERK1/2 activation. However, carbachol stimulated ERK1/2 activation appears to have, like a depolarising stimulus, a Ras-dependent and a Rasindependent pathway mediating ERK1/2 activation, potentially due to the L-type VGCC activation initiated by carbachol.
Overall this thesis demonstrates that the L-type VGCC is a key mediator in ERK1/2 activation in β-cells. Both GLP-1 and mAChR stimulation requires the activity of the Ltype VGCC to mediate Ca2+-dependent ERK1/2 activation, and I have provided evidence that a Ras-independent Ca2+-dependent pathway leading to ERK1/2 activation is initiated within the microdomain of the L-type VGCC and can stimulate transcription.",0.027154340422787412,282350,"Biochemical investigation of phosphodiesterase type IV post-translational modification, cellular localisation and interaction with associated binding proteins","cAMP is a secondary messenger that is involved in a variety of signalling pathways through its effectors including EPAC, PKA and ion channels. cAMP signalling regulates processes such as memory, muscle contraction and inflammatory responses. PDE enzymes offer a mechanism to negatively regulate elevated cAMP levels elicited by activators of adenylyl cyclase. Studies have shown that cAMP signalling is compartmentalised through binding of PDEs to A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) that scaffold PKA regulatory subunits. 

In this study post-translational-modification of PDE4 isoforms is investigated. SUMOylation is a relatively newly identified post-translational modification that is known to regulate the structure and function of its substrates. PDE4 isoforms of the PDE4A and 4D subfamilies are SUMOylated by an E3 ligase, PIASy. SUMOylation alters the rolipram sensitivity and potentiates the PKA mediated activation of the isoforms whilst it confers protection from ERK-mediated inhibition of PDE4 activity. SUMOylation alters the association of PDE4 isoforms with binding partners like β-Arrestin, AKAP18 δ and UBC9. 

Rolipram is an archetypal PDE4 specific inhibitor. In this study it is shown that in cells expressing a GFP tagged form of PDE4A4 undergoes redistribution into accretion foci upon chronic treatment with rolipram. Data suggests that foci formation requires protein turnover and is regulated by signalling pathways such as PI3 kinase pathway, p38 MAP kinase pathway and PKC pathways. Further, the Immunomodulatory drug Thalidomide® also inhibits foci formation. 

PDE4 isoforms have isoforms specific N-terminal regions, which play a crucial role in sub-cellular localisation and protein-protein interactions. It is shown here that PDE4D5 interacts with a novel RhoGAP called ARHGAP21 which has been previously reported to bind β-arrestins. This interaction is independent of GAP activity of ARHGAP as well as PDE4 activity. Previous reports have indicated a role of β-Arrestin, PDE4 and ARHGAP21 in regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Hence complex β-Arrestin-PDE4-ARHGAP21 may play a crucial role in regulating actin dynamics.",0.02808940747189259,99719,Opposing Changes in Phosphorylation of Specific Sites in Synapsin I During Ca2-Dependent Glutamate Release in Isolated Nerve Terminals,"Synapsins are major neuronal phosphoproteins involved in regulation

Overlay studies with PDE4D5 scanning peptide array libraries showed that RACK1 and &#946;-arrestin interact at overlapping sites within the unique N-terminal region of PDE4D5 and at distinct sites within the conserved PDE4 catalytic domain. Screening scanning alanine substitution peptide arrays, coupled with mutagenesis and truncation studies, allowed definition of RACK1 and &#946;-arrestin interaction sites. Modelled on the PDE4D catalytic domain, these form distinct well-defined surface-exposed patches on helices-15–16, for RACK1, and helix-17 for &#946;-arrestin. siRNA (small interfering RNA)-mediated knockdown of RACK1 in HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney) B2 cells increased &#946;-arrestin-scaffolded PDE4D5 approx. 5-fold, increased PDE4D5 recruited to the &#946;2AR (&#946;2-adrenergic receptor) upon isoproterenol challenge approx. 4-fold and severely attenuated (approx. 4–5 fold) both isoproterenol-stimulated PKA (protein kinase A) phosphorylation of the &#946;2AR and activation of ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase).

A recent study identified the novel small molecule R406 as a selective inhibitor of Syk. Objectives: The present study evaluates the role of Syk in human platelets using the novel inhibitor R406. Methods: Agonist-induced GPVI and CLEC-2 signaling were assessed using aggregometry, immunoprecipitation and western blotting to determine the effects of R406 on platelet activation. Results: We demonstrate R406 to be a powerful inhibitor of Syk in human platelets. R406 abrogated shape change and aggregation induced by activation of GPVI and CLEC-2, and reduced platelet spreading on fibrinogen. The inhibitory effect of R406 was associated with inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling proteins that lay downstream of Syk for all three receptors, including PLCc2.Strikingly, R406 markedly inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of CLEC-2 and Syk downstream of CLEC-2 activation,whereas phosphorylation of Syk downstream of GPVI and integrin aIIbb3 was unaffected. Conclusions: The inhibitory effect of R406 provides direct evidence of a role for Syk in GPVI, CLEC-2 and integrin aIIbb3 signaling in human platelets. Further, the results demonstrate a critical role for Syk in mediating tyrosine phosphorylation of CLEC-2,suggesting a novel model in which both Src and Syk kinases mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of the C-type lectin receptor leading to platelet activation.",0.048619318258445336,5222960,an investigation into the role of neurotransmitter receptors in the function of human immune cells,"The interaction between the nervous and immune system is well documented, although is still not fully understood - particularly the impact of neurotransmitter receptors on immune cell function. 5-HT\(_3\)A receptor expression was identified on activated regulatory T cells (Treg) but not on effector T cells.

Nonetheless, the role played by XOR during inflammation is poorly understood. We previously observed that inhibition of XOR within the inflammatory mononuclear phagocytes (MNP) prevented neutrophil recruitment during adoptive transfer demonstrating the role of XOR in MNP-mediated neutrophil recruitment. To further explore the role of XOR in the inflammatory state of MNP, we studied MNP isolated from inflammatory lungs combined with analyses of MNP cell lines. We demonstrated that XOR activity was increased in inflammatory MNP following insufflation of Th-1 cytokines in vivo and that activity was specifically increased by MNP differentiation. Inhibition of XOR reduced levels of CINC-1 secreted by MNP. Expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) in purified rat lung MNP and MNP cell lines reflected both the presence of PPAR gamma isoforms and PPAR gamma SUMOylation, and XOR inhibitors increased levels of SUMO-PPAR gamma in MNP cell lines. Both ectopic overexpression of XOR cDNA and uric acid supplementation reduced SUMO-PPAR gamma in MNP cells. Levels of the M2 markers CD36, CD206, and arginase-1 were modulated by uric acid and oxonic acid, whereas siRNA to SUMO-1 or PIAS-1 also reduced arginase-1 in RAW264.7 cells. We also observed that HIF-1 alpha was increased by XOR inhibitors in inflammatory MNP and in MNP cell lines.

Previously, the Xenopus laevis oocyte expression system has been used to characterize GluCl channels cloned from Caenorhabditis elegans. However, information on the native, pharmacologically relevant receptors is lacking. Here, we have used a quantitative pharmacological approach and intracellular recording techniques of C. elegans pharynx to characterize them. 

The glutamate response was a rapidly desensitizing, reversible, chloride-dependent depolarization (EC50 = 166 muM), only weakly antagonized by picrotoxin. The order of potency of agonists was ibotenate > L-glutamate > kainate = quisqualate. Ivermectin potently and irreversibly depolarized the muscle (EC50 = 2.7 nM). No further depolarization was seen with coapplication of maximal glutamate during the maximal ivermectin response, indicating that ivermectin depolarizes the muscle by the same ionic mechanism as glutamate (i.e., chloride). 

The potency of ivermectin on the pharynx was greater than at any of the GluCl subunits expressed in X. laevis oocytes. This effect of ivermectin was abolished in the mutant avr-15, which lacks a functional GluCl-alpha (2) subunit. However, a chloride-dependent, nondesensitizing response to glutamate persisted. Therefore, the GluCl-alpha (2) subunit confers ivermectin sensitivity and a high-affinity desensitizing glutamate response on the native pharyngeal GluCl receptor.",0.06289791925216226,glove,normalmean

These complex cascades often employ crosstalk with other signalling pathways to exert strict control to allow for correct cellular responses. The cyclic AMP signalling pathway is involved in a wide range of cellular processes which require tight control, including cell proliferation and differentiation, metabolism and inflammation. Protein Kinase C (PKC) signalling is also involved in the regulation of many biological functions, due to the wide range of PKC isoforms, and there is emerging evidence that there are critical points of crosstalk between these two central signalling pathways. The aims of this research, therefore, are to identify the molecular basis underlying this pivotal cross-communication.

The identification of the complex formed by Receptor for activated C Kinase 1 (RACK1), a scaffold protein for PKC, and the cyclic AMP-specific phosphodiesterase PDE4D5 demonstrated a potential area of crosstalk between the cyclic AMP and PKC signalling pathways although the function of the complex remained largely unknown. In this thesis I have outlined a role for RACK1 binding to PDE4D5 to control the enzymatic activity of the phosphodiesterase. Although RACK1 does not affect the intracellular localisation of PDE4D5, it does afford structural stability to PDE4D5, providing protection against denaturation. Furthermore, interaction with RACK1 facilitates high affinity binding of PDE4D5 to cyclic AMP and increases phosphodiesterase sensitivity to inhibition by rolipram, a PDE4-specific inhibitor that is a therapeutic treatment for depression and Alzheimer’s disease. Additionally, RACK1-bound PDE4D5 was found to be activated by PKCα, providing a route of negative regulation by PKC on cyclic AMP in HEK293 cells. 

The discovery of EPAC (Exchange Protein directly Activated by Cyclic AMP) has opened up the field of cyclic AMP research, providing an alternative route for the cyclic AMP signalling originally thought to occur solely through Protein Kinase A (PKA). Recent investigations have linked cyclic AMP signalling via EPAC to the control of inflammation, through the induction of Suppressor of Cytokine Signalling 3 (SOCS-3) to inhibit IL-6 signalling. Here I have further delineated this pathway in COS1 to show that induction of SOCS-3 by EPAC requires phospholipase C (PLC) ε. Investigation into downstream effectors of PLC action lead to the identification of PKCα and PKCδ as essential components of this pathway, further elucidating a mechanism by which cyclic AMP can affect inflammation and revealing a point of crosstalk between the two signalling pathways.

Further elaborating on the identification of PKC isoforms α and δ as crucial components in the control of cytokine signalling by cyclic AMP via EPAC, investigations into the effect of cyclic AMP on PKC α and δ activation and autophosphorylation, and on downstream effectors, were carried out. It was revealed that cyclic AMP had no influence on PKCδ activity, although a role for cyclic AMP signalling through EPAC on the activation and autophosphorylation of PKCα was identified. Additionally, phosphorylation of the downstream kinase ERK was found to occur independently of PKC activation and required the presence of EPAC1 in COS1 cells.

The work presented in this thesis therefore begins to delineate a novel pathway in which the cyclic AMP and PKC pathways work together to afford cell regulation, including the regulation of gene expression, through novel areas of crosstalk.",0.02702577182897181,99719,Opposing Changes in Phosphorylation of Specific Sites in Synapsin I During Ca2-Dependent Glutamate Release in Isolated Nerve Terminals,"Synapsins are major neuronal phosphoproteins involved in regulation

We demonstrate that, in vitro, phosphorylation sites 1, 2, and 3
of synapsin I (P-site 1 phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent
protein kinase; P-sites 2 and 3 phosphorylated by Ca2–
calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) were excellent substrates
for protein phosphatase 2A, whereas P-sites 4, 5, and 6 (phosphorylated
by mitogen-activated protein kinase) were efficiently
dephosphorylated only by Ca2–calmodulin-dependent protein
phosphatase 2B–calcineurin. In isolated nerve terminals, rapid
changes in synapsin I phosphorylation were observed after Ca2
entry, namely, a Ca2-dependent phosphorylation of P-sites 1, 2,
and 3 and a Ca2-dependent dephosphorylation of P-sites 4, 5,
and 6. Inhibition of calcineurin activity by cyclosporin A resulted in
a complete block of Ca2-dependent dephosphorylation of
P-sites 4, 5, and 6 and correlated with a prominent increase in
ionomycin-evoked glutamate release. These two opposing, rapid,
Ca2-dependent processes may play a crucial role in the modulation
of synaptic vesicle trafficking within the presynaptic terminal.",0.028235889062864675,2753595,The in vitro and in vivo enantioselectivity of etomidate implicates the GABAA receptor in general anaesthesia,"General anaesthetics exhibiting enantioselectivity afford valuable tools to assess the fundamental mechanisms underlying anaesthesia. Here, we characterised the actions of the R-(+)- and S-(−)-enantiomers of etomidate. In mice and tadpoles, R-(+)-etomidate was more potent (˜10-fold) than S-(−)-etomidate in producing loss of the righting reflex. In electrophysiological and radioligand binding assays, the enantiomers of etomidate positively regulated GABAA receptor function at anaesthetic concentrations and with an enantioselectivity paralleling their in vivo activity. GABA-evoked currents mediated by human recombinant GABAA receptors were potentiated by either R-(+)- or S-(−)-etomidate in a manner dependent upon receptor subunit composition. A direct, GABA-mimetic, effect was similarly subunit dependent. Modulation of GABA receptor activity was selective; R-(+)-etomidate inhibited nicotinic acetylcholine, or 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptor subtypes only at supra-clinical concentrations and ionotropic glutamate receptor isoforms were essentially unaffected. Acting upon reticulothalamic neurones in rat brain slices, R-(+)-etomidate prolonged the duration of miniature IPSCs and modestly enhanced their peak amplitude. S-(−)-etomidate exerted qualitatively similar, but weaker, actions. In a model of locomotor activity, fictive swimming in Xenopus laevis tadpoles, R-(+)- but not S-(−)-etomidate exerted a depressant influence via enhancement of GABAergic neurotransmission. Collectively, these observations strongly implicate the GABAA receptor as a molecular target relevant to the anaesthetic action of etomidate.",0.028383499282546576,fasttext,pmean
1,1,10359,Radiocarbon and stable carbon analysis of dissolved methane and carbon dioxide from the profile of a raised peat bog,"We developed and tested a new method to separate CO2 and CH4 from bulk gas samples for radiocarbon  and stable-carbon analysis that utilizes zeolite molecular sieve. To validate the technique, tests were performed using a suite of standard gases, composed of CO2 and CH4 of distinctly different isotopic composition. We employed the method to investigate the carbon isotopic composition of samples of dissolved CO2 and CH4 collected in situ from the near surface to deep layers of an ombrotrophic raised peat bog. Results showed that the age of both the CO2 and CH4 components of the dissolved gases increased with depth from ~ 0–300 BP at 0.25 m to ~ 4000 BP at 4 m. CH4 was mainly similar or slightly older in age compared to CO2, with the greatest difference in ages occurring at 1 m depth where CH4 was older by 430-615 years. The &#948;13C values of CO2 increased with depth from -12.4 ‰ and -8.0 ‰ at 0.25 m to +6.9 ‰ and +8.3 ‰ at 4 m, whereas the &#948;13C of CH4 stayed in the range -58.4 ‰ to -70.6 ‰. The 14C results from the deepest layers are consistent with a similar source for both gases. 14C ages for the CO2 component were younger compared to CH4, within the shallower depths of the peat bog (&#8804; 1 m) and demonstrate the incorporation of acrotelm-derived respired CO2 into the catotelm.",1592242,Numerical modelling of basin-scale impact crater formation,"Understanding of basin-scale crater formation is limited; only a few examples
of basin-scale craters exist and these are difficult to access. The approach
adopted in this research was to numerically model basin-scale impacts with
the aim of understanding the basin-forming process and basin structure.
Research was divided into: (1) investigating early stage formation processes
(impactor survivability), (2) investigating later stage formation processes
(excavation and modification) and basin structure, and (3) constraining an
impact scenario for the largest lunar crater, the South Pole-Aitken Basin.
Various impact parameters were investigated, quantifying their effect on the
basin-forming process.
Simulations showed impactor survivability, the fraction of impactor remaining
solid during the impact process, greatly increased if the impactor
was prolate in shape (vertical length > horizontal length) rather than spherical.
Low (≲15 km/s) impact velocities and low impact angles (≲30 ) also
noticeably increased survivability.
Lunar basin-scale simulations removed a significant volume of crustal material
during impact, producing thinner post-impact crustal layers than those
suggested by gravity-derived basin data. Most simulations formed large, predominantly
mantle, melt pools; inclusion of a steep target thermal gradient
and high internal temperatures greatly influenced melt volume production.
Differences in crustal thickness between simulations and gravity-derived data
could be accounted for by differentiation of the voluminous impact-generated
melt pools, predicted by the simulations, into new crustal layers. Assuming
differentiation occurs, simulation results were used to predict features such as
transient crater size for a suite of lunar basins and tentatively suggest lunar
thermal conditions during the basin-forming epoch. Additional simulations
concerned the formation of the South Pole-Aitken Basin. By constraining
simulation results to geochemical and gravity-derived basin data, a best-fit
impact scenario for the South Pole-Aitken Basin was found.",0.02973499336153862,2800455,Using earth observation data to evaluate the performance of a land surface model at high northern latitudes,"Recent decades have seen large changes in the environment of high northern latitude land areas, including warming and changes in snow and vegetation cover, and these are the subject of research using increasingly sophisticated models. There is a need to evaluate the models against observational data, both to quantify the performance of the current models and to guide future developments. Although data from field campaigns are an important resource, Earth Observation (EO) products are increasingly being used as the only practicable means for evaluation at the large spatial scales over which models are routinely applied.
The Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) is a process-based model that simulates the fluxes of carbon, water, energy and momentum between the land surface and the atmosphere. JULES includes parameterisations of cold season processes, including a multi-layer model of the snow pack and soil freezing and thawing processes. In this paper we compare simulations of the Northern Hemisphere using JULES to a range of EO products. The EO products monitor snow cover (e.g. from ESA DUE GlobSnow, MODIS), snow water equivalent (e.g. GlobSnow), surface state (frozen/unfrozen/melting, from ESA STSE ALANIS-Methane/DUE Permafrost) and surface temperature (e.g. AATSR, MODIS).
Uncertainty in the EO products arises in part because these products themselves involve models of radiative transfer processes. By comparing several quantities from a range of products we develop a consistent picture of the performance of JULES over large areas, and get a qualitative estimate of EO uncertainty. We also investigate uncertainty in the outputs from JULES that arises from uncertainties in the parameterisations and in the input data (e.g. meteorology). We propose to incorporate EO products that describe snow and frozen ground into the routine benchmarking of JULES and other land surface models.",0.031619011509933403,61049,Rapid geohazard assessment system for the UK Natural Gas Pipeline Network,"The British Geological Survey (BGS) and National Grid Transco (NGT) have produced a new GIS for the rapid assessment of the potential for a significant geohazard to adversely affect any section of the UK natural gas pipeline transmission network. NGT is responsible for the safety and maintenance of the 18 000 km long high-pressure transmission network that supplies gas to business and domestic consumers across the UK.
Health and Safety Legislation in the UK requires NGT to demonstrate that the risks to individuals living and working in the vicinity of gas pipelines are adequately managed. In order to enhance its capabilities for assessing the risks due to geological ground conditions NGT required detailed information about the distribution and potential severity of geohazards across the UK. BGS, as the primary holder of national geological hazard data in the UK, were commissioned to design suitable GIS layers as part of the risk assessment methodology.
Of the many geohazards that affect the UK, landsliding and the dissolution of soluble rocks were considered to pose the greatest threat to the transmission network. Other hazards, such as clay shrinkage, running sand and compressible ground, were considered to be of significance only during pipeline construction and were not thought likely to cause rupture during operation. BGS national hazard datasets for landslide and dissolution hazard were truncated to buffer zones centred upon the pipeline. These data were enhanced by detailed information from the BGS National Landslide Database and Karst Database.
The result of this research was a set of continuous GIS layers that show the level of potential hazard from landsliding or dissolution of soluble rocks at any location on the pipeline network in the UK. NGT will be using this data to: improve their risk assessment methodology in this area; inform discussions on pipeline safety with their safety regulator and to improve their surveillance strategies where it is considered that geohazards represent a potential threat to the integrity of the pipeline.",0.03181963159164325,9706,Analysis of the fractal clustering of ore deposits in the Spanish Iberian Pyrite Belt,"The Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB) contains one of the greatest known concentrations of volcanic-hosted massive
sulfides (VHMS) on Earth. Investigation of the spatial attributes of the mineralization using fractal methods,
over a range of scales, and integrated within a GIS provides new information, of potential import to the
exploration of VHMS deposits. At the mine-scale, stockworks, which act as feeders for hydrothermal fluids,
show vein thickness distributions that are power-law (Dt≈0.65 in one dimension) at length scales from
about 10−2 to 102 m. Box-counting of veins indicates a capacity dimension (Dc) in the range of 1.60–1.65 in
two dimensions, which is consistent with the vein thickness data. At larger scales, in the range 103 to 105 m,
the distribution of mines and mineral prospects can be modelled as a fractal dust. When all the known
mineral deposits and prospects are analyzed they have a capacity dimension Dc≈1.3. The VHMS deposits
alone have a capacity dimension Dc≈0.9, indicating that they are clustered, with some indication that the
‘world-class’ deposits may be even more clustered. The different fractal analyses are integrated with
information from geological and geophysical maps using a GIS. The distribution of prospects has been
simulated using a simple multifractal model of the ore concentration and is constrained by known geological
controls. Such a model has been implemented through the GIS.",0.03291009000262424,9543401,A novel palaeoaltimetry proxy based on spore and pollen wall chemistry,"Understanding the uplift history and the evolution of high altitude plateaux is of major interest to a wide range of geoscientists and has implications for many disparate fields.  Currently the majority of palaeoaltimetry proxies are based on detecting a physical change in climate in response to uplift, making the relationship between uplift and climate difficult to decipher. Furthermore, current palaeoaltimetry proxies have a low degree of precision with errors typically greater than 1 km.  This makes the calculation of uplift histories and the identification of the mechanisms responsible for uplift difficult to determine.  Here we report on advances in both instrumentation and our understanding of the biogeochemical structure of sporopollenin that are leading to the establishment of a new proxy to track changes in the flux of UV-B radiation over geological time.  The UV-B proxy is based on quantifying changes in the concentration of UV-B absorbing compounds (UACs) found in the spores and pollen grains of land plants, with the relative abundances of UACs increasing on exposure to elevated UV-B radiation.  Given the physical relationship between altitude and UV-B radiation we suggest that the analysis of sporopollenin chemistry, specifically changes in the concentration of UACs, may offer the basis for the first climate independent palaeoaltimetry proxy.  Owing to the ubiquity of spores and pollen in the fossil record our proposed proxy has the potential to enable the reconstruction of the uplift history of high altitude plateaux at unprecedented levels of fidelity, both spatially and temporally.",0.033316775120792015,fasttext,pmean

In the present studies, mechanisms underlying the acute and chronic nicotinic enhancement of LTP were examined. In particular, the involvement of activation of intracellular kinases was examined using selective kinase antagonists, and the effects of enhancing cholinergic function with positive allosteric modulators of the α7 nAChR and with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors were also investigated. Activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) was found to be involved in the induction of the acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP, although not control LTP.

The major effect of adenosine is to suppress network activity via the activation of A1 receptors. Here we report that in immature cerebellar slices, the activation of A1 receptors has variable effects on parallel fibre synaptic transmission, ranging from zero depression to an almost complete abolition of transmission. Concentration–response curves suggest that the heterogeneity of inhibition stems from differences in A1 receptor properties which could include coupling to downstream effectors. There is less variation in the effects of adenosine at parallel fibre synapses in slices from older rats and thus adenosine signalling appears developmentally regulated.
In the cerebellum, hypoxia increases the concentration of extracellular adenosine leading to the activation of A1 receptors (at adenosine-sensitive parallel fibre synapses) and the suppression of glutamate release. It would be predicted that the synapses that were insensitive to adenosine would be less depressed by hypoxia and thus maintain function during metabolic stress. However those synapses which were insensitive to adenosine were rapidly inhibited by hypoxia via a mechanism which was not reversed by blocking A1 receptors. Thus another mechanism must be responsible for the hypoxia-mediated depression at these synapses. These different mechanisms of depression may be important for cell survival and for maintenance of cerebellar function following oxygen starvation.",0.02474502409034629,7376847,Excitotoxic ATP and Glutamate Signalling during Central Nervous System Ischaemia,"Neural cell death plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of various ischaemic disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), most prominently stroke, causing very significant mortality and morbidity. Severe ischaemia rapidly kills both neurons and astrocytes, two CNS cell types whose interactions are essential to normal brain functioning, so ideally a target needs to be found which will protect both. Glutamate mediated excitotoxicity, the process whereby excessive extracellular glutamate causes cell death via the over-activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors, is known to operate during ischaemia.
However, there is increasing evidence that ATP mediated excitotoxicity may also occur.  Using an in vitro model of ischaemia (oxygen-glucose deprivation: OGD) and various murine primary cortical cell cultures, I investigated the hypothesis that parallel pathways of ATP and glutamate mediated excitotoxicity contribute to the death of both astrocytes and neurons during ischaemia. OGD produced rapid and significant ATP and glutamate release from co-cultures of astrocytes and neurons, as measured using microelectrode biosensors. Glutamate release was mainly from astrocytes, whereas the cellular origin of ATP was less clear. Ca2+ imaging of Fura-2 loaded cells confirmed functional P2 receptor expression in all astrocytes and 60% of neurons along with glutamate receptor expression in all neurons but only a small proportion of astrocytes. During OGD, blocking NMDA and AMPA/kainate receptors significantly reduced neuronal death, while non-selective P2 receptor antagonists as well as selective P2Y1 (but not P2X7) receptor antagonists prevented the death of both neurons and astrocytes. Furthermore, a synergistic protective effect was produced by combining low concentrations of P2 and glutamate receptor antagonists, reducing cell death to control levels. These results suggest that ATP and glutamate, acting at P2 and ionotropic glutamate receptors, are the main mediators of early cell death during severe CNS ischaemia, and thus represent a potential target for powerful neuroprotective strategies.",0.025173788528497054,99719,Opposing Changes in Phosphorylation of Specific Sites in Synapsin I During Ca2-Dependent Glutamate Release in Isolated Nerve Terminals,"Synapsins are major neuronal phosphoproteins involved in regulation
of neurotransmitter release. Synapsins are well established
targets for multiple protein kinases within the nerve
terminal, yet little is known about dephosphorylation processes
involved in regulation of synapsin function. Here, we observed
a reciprocal relationship in the phosphorylation–dephosphorylation

We demonstrate that, in vitro, phosphorylation sites 1, 2, and 3

a complete block of Ca2-dependent dephosphorylation of

Adenoviral transduction of perirhinal cortex (and adjacent visual association cortex) with a dominant-negative inhibitor of CREB impaired the preferential exploration of novel over familiar objects at a long (24 h) but not a short (15 min) delay, disrupted the normal reduced activation of perirhinal neurons to familiar compared with novel pictures, and impaired long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission in perirhinal slices. The consistency of these effects across the behavioral, systems, and cellular levels of analysis provides strong evidence for involvement of CREB phosphorylation in synaptic plastic processes within perirhinal cortex necessary for long-term recognition memory.",0.02897127541184663,word2vec,pmean

Minestone is dominated by the clay-bearing mudrocks and shales of the Coal Measures. Consequently, engineering problems are often encountered due to the likelihood of these rocks undergoing volume change and degradation when exposed to fluctuations in moisture content. In addition, iron sulphides (chiefly pyrite) are frequently present in minestone as diagenetic minerals which on excavation have the potential to oxidise forming sulphate minerals. The oxidation of sulphides may in itself contribute to volume increase in pyritic rocks and sulphate minerals may combine with the products of cement hydration to produce further expansion. The physical and chemical properties of a wide range of minestones are determined and attempts are made to correlate these with the engineering performance of cement stabilised specimens subjected to short-term immersion in water. Criteria, based on these raw material indices are proposed with a view to eliminating minestones which are unsuitable. A long-term durability study is also described. In this, the geochemical stability of pyrite in CSM was examined together with the role played by the sulphur bearing mineralogy in determining the engineering performance of CSM's exposed to conditions of increased moisture availability.

These structures must be secured to the seabed in an efficient and cost effective manner. A novel approach is to use shallow inverted buckets as foundations, installed by suction, in place of the more usual piles. These foundations lead to cost savings through reduction in materials and in time required for installation. It is necessary to determine how these foundations perform under typical offshore loading conditions so that design calculations may be developed. This thesis presents experimental data from a comprehensive series of investigations aimed at determining the important mechanisms to consider in the design of these shallow foundations for dense sand. 

Initially the long term loading behaviour (e.g. wind and current) was investigated by conducting three degree of freedom loading {V:M/2R:H} tests on a foundation embedded in dry sand. The results were interpreted through existing work-hardening plasticity theories. The analysis of the data has suggested a number of improved modelling features. Cyclic and transient tests, representing wave loading, were carried out on a foundation embedded in an oil saturated sand. The novel feature of the cyclic loading was that a 'pseudo-random' load history (based on the 'NewWave' theory) was used to represent realistic loading paths. Of particular interest was the tensile load capacity of the foundation. The results observed suggested that for tensile loading serviceability requirements rather than capacity may govern design. Under combined-load cyclic conditions the results indicated that conventional plasticity theory would not provide a sufficient description of response. A new theory, termed 'continuous hyperplasticity' was used, reproducing the results with impressive accuracy. Surprisingly, under the conditions investigated, loading rate was found to have a negligible effect on response.",0.03985356766459025,1621177,Recent advances in computational fluid dynamics relevant to the modelling of pesticide flow on leaf surfaces,"Increasing societal and governmental concern about the worldwide use of chemical pesticides is now providing strong drivers towards maximising the efficiency of pesticide utilisation and the development of alternative control techniques. There is growing recognition that the ultimate goal of achieving efficient and sustainable pesticide usage will require greater understanding of the fluid mechanical mechanisms governing the delivery to, and spreading of, pesticide droplets on target surfaces such as leaves. This has led to increasing use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) as an important component of efficient process design with regard to pesticide delivery to the leaf surface. This perspective highlights recent advances in CFD methods for droplet spreading and film flows, which have the potential to provide accurate, predictive models for pesticide flow on leaf surfaces, and which can take account of each of the key influences of surface topography and chemistry, initial spray deposition conditions, evaporation and multiple droplet spreading interactions. The mathematical framework of these CFD methods is described briefly, and a series of new flow simulation results relevant to pesticide flows over foliage is provided. The potential benefits of employing CFD for practical process design are also discussed briefly.",0.040053047096706096,9050391,Soil Limitations to Agrarian Land Production in Premodern Iceland,"Early arable activity in Iceland, introduced in the late ninth century A.D., has
been characterized as marginal and at a subsistence level, largely abandoned by
the 1500s as a result of climatic deterioration. This view has been advanced
without considering soils data, the medium in which crops are grown and in which
evidence of early land management is retained. Soil thin section micromorphology
together with soil total phosphorus values are used to assess land manuring and
cultivation strategies at two sites in south-west Iceland, where place name and
palynological evidence indicate that arable activity has taken place. Agro-
ecosystem modeling, using the CENTURY model, is undertaken to predict grain
yields at these sites, and to assess the significance of soil properties and
soil management in determining yields. The results of these analyses demonstrate
that manure application rates were low, and support the view that grain yields
were at a subsistence level. The results also suggest soils, and the management
of soils, rather than climate was the major limitation to arable production.
Shortages of both available manure and labor are suggested as barriers to soils
and grain productivity improvements in early Iceland. The paper highlights the
need to include soils analyses in discussions of early agricultural economies.",0.040605270527596334,word2vec,pmean

Activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) was found to be involved in the induction of the acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP, although not control LTP. In contrast, activation of the tyrosine kinase Src, Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, Janus kinase 2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase was not involved in the acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP, although Src activation was necessary for control LTP. Moreover, activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase was involved in the acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP to a much lesser extent than in control LTP. Chronic nicotine enhancement of LTP was found to be dependent on PKA, ERK and Src kinases. Acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP was occluded by chronic nicotine treatment. The positive allosteric modulator PNU-120596 was found to strongly reduce the threshold for nicotinic enhancement of LTP, an affect mediated via the α7 nAChR as it was blocked by the selective antagonist methyllycaconitine. The AChE inhibitors tacrine and physostigmine enhanced control LTP.",0.0,7376691,Phenylephrine preconditioning of isolated ventricular myocytes involves modulation of KATP channels through activation of survival kinases,"Pretreatment with the α1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine has been shown to protect cardiac tissue from a subsequent period of ischaemia. This phenomenon, known as pharmacological preconditioning, decreases infarct size and increases the functional recovery of the intact heart. The role of protein kinases and ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP) in phenylephrine preconditioning was investigated in isolated ventricular myocytes using whole cell patch clamp, western blotting, fluorescence imaging and measurement of contractile activity. The role of PKC isoforms was examined using isoform-specific PKC activator and inhibitor peptides.
Preconditioning with phenylephrine increased the contractile recovery of isolated ventricular myocytes following simulated ischaemia and reperfusion, and this was also correlated with an improvement in calcium homeostasis during reperfusion. The protective effect of phenylephrine preconditioning on contractile recovery was abolished by inhibition of α1-adrenoceptors, PKC or KATP. We observed a sustained activation of PKCε and δ in response to phenylephrine preconditioning, and identified a protective role for PKCε. PKCδ was required for phenylephrine preconditioning but also increased reperfusion injury. CaMKK, AMPK and p38 MAPK were all required for phenylephrine preconditioning, and activation of AMPK by phenylephrine preconditioning required PKCδ. However, both JNK and ERK appear not to be involved in the protective effect.
Inhibition of sarcolemmal KATP channels (sarcKATP) or mitochondrial KATP channels (mitoKATP) prevented preconditioning. Peak sarcKATP current activated by metabolic inhibition was increased following phenylephrine preconditioning and inhibition of PKCδ, AMPK or p38 MAPK was sufficient to prevent the increase in current.
Increased sarcKATP current can enhance hyperpolarisation of the resting membrane potential, and may be responsible for the observed decrease in calcium loading and improved contractile recovery of phenylephrine preconditioned ventricular myocytes following ischaemia and reperfusion.",0.02531387616738745,19237,The tyrosine phosphatase CD148 is an essential positive regulator of platelet activation and thrombosis,"Platelets play a fundamental role in hemostasis and thrombosis. They are also involved in pathologic conditions resulting from blocked blood vessels, including myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. Platelet adhesion, activation, and aggregation at sites of vascular injury are regulated by a diverse repertoire of tyrosine kinase–linked and G protein–coupled receptors. Src family kinases (SFKs) play a central role in initiating and propagating signaling from several platelet surface receptors; however, the underlying mechanism of how SFK activity is regulated in platelets remains unclear. CD148 is the only receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase identified in platelets to date. In the present study, we show that mutant mice lacking CD148 exhibited a bleeding tendency and defective arterial thrombosis. Basal SFK activity was found to be markedly reduced in CD148-deficient platelets, resulting in a global hyporesponsiveness to agonists that signal through SFKs, including collagen and fibrinogen. G protein–coupled receptor responses to thrombin and other agonists were also marginally reduced. These results highlight CD148 as a global regulator of platelet activation and a novel antithrombotic drug target",0.025417376013960213,2752345,Hypomorphic mutation of PDK1 suppresses tumorigenesis in PTEN(+/-) mice,"Many cancers possess elevated levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, the second messenger that induces activation of the protein kinases PKB/Akt and S6K and thereby stimulates cell proliferation, growth, and survival [[1] and [2]]. The importance of this pathway in tumorigenesis has been highlighted by the finding that PTEN, the lipid phosphatase that breaks down PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 to PtdIns(4,5)P2, is frequently mutated in human cancer [[3] and [4]].Cells lacking PTEN possess elevated levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, PKB, and S6K activity [[5], [6], [7] and [8]] and heterozygous PTEN+/− mice develop a variety of tumors [[9], [10] and [11]]. Knockout of PKBα in PTEN-deficient cells reduces aggressive growth and promotes apoptosis [12], whereas treatment of PTEN+/− mice with rapamycin, an inhibitor of the activation of S6K, reduces neoplasia [13]. We explored the importance of PDK1, the protein kinase that activates PKB and S6K [14], in mediating tumorigenesis caused by the deletion of PTEN. We demonstrate that reducing the expression of PDK1 in PTEN+/− mice, markedly protects these animals from developing a wide range of tumors. Our findings provide genetic evidence that PDK1 is a key effector in mediating neoplasia resulting from loss of PTEN and also validate PDK1 as a promising anticancer target for the prevention of tumors that possess elevated PKB and S6K activity.",0.0283849993062103,282289,Novel areas of crosstalk between the cyclic AMP and PKC signalling pathways,"Mediation of biological functions occurs via tightly regulated signal transduction pathways. These complex cascades often employ crosstalk with other signalling pathways to exert strict control to allow for correct cellular responses. The cyclic AMP signalling pathway is involved in a wide range of cellular processes which require tight control, including cell proliferation and differentiation, metabolism and inflammation. Protein Kinase C (PKC) signalling is also involved in the regulation of many biological functions, due to the wide range of PKC isoforms, and there is emerging evidence that there are critical points of crosstalk between these two central signalling pathways. The aims of this research, therefore, are to identify the molecular basis underlying this pivotal cross-communication.

The identification of the complex formed by Receptor for activated C Kinase 1 (RACK1), a scaffold protein for PKC, and the cyclic AMP-specific phosphodiesterase PDE4D5 demonstrated a potential area of crosstalk between the cyclic AMP and PKC signalling pathways although the function of the complex remained largely unknown. In this thesis I have outlined a role for RACK1 binding to PDE4D5 to control the enzymatic activity of the phosphodiesterase. Although RACK1 does not affect the intracellular localisation of PDE4D5, it does afford structural stability to PDE4D5, providing protection against denaturation. Furthermore, interaction with RACK1 facilitates high affinity binding of PDE4D5 to cyclic AMP and increases phosphodiesterase sensitivity to inhibition by rolipram, a PDE4-specific inhibitor that is a therapeutic treatment for depression and Alzheimer’s disease. Additionally, RACK1-bound PDE4D5 was found to be activated by PKCα, providing a route of negative regulation by PKC on cyclic AMP in HEK293 cells. 

The discovery of EPAC (Exchange Protein directly Activated by Cyclic AMP) has opened up the field of cyclic AMP research, providing an alternative route for the cyclic AMP signalling originally thought to occur solely through Protein Kinase A (PKA). Recent investigations have linked cyclic AMP signalling via EPAC to the control of inflammation, through the induction of Suppressor of Cytokine Signalling 3 (SOCS-3) to inhibit IL-6 signalling. Here I have further delineated this pathway in COS1 to show that induction of SOCS-3 by EPAC requires phospholipase C (PLC) ε. Investigation into downstream effectors of PLC action lead to the identification of PKCα and PKCδ as essential components of this pathway, further elucidating a mechanism by which cyclic AMP can affect inflammation and revealing a point of crosstalk between the two signalling pathways.

Further elaborating on the identification of PKC isoforms α and δ as crucial components in the control of cytokine signalling by cyclic AMP via EPAC, investigations into the effect of cyclic AMP on PKC α and δ activation and autophosphorylation, and on downstream effectors, were carried out. It was revealed that cyclic AMP had no influence on PKCδ activity, although a role for cyclic AMP signalling through EPAC on the activation and autophosphorylation of PKCα was identified. Additionally, phosphorylation of the downstream kinase ERK was found to occur independently of PKC activation and required the presence of EPAC1 in COS1 cells.

The work presented in this thesis therefore begins to delineate a novel pathway in which the cyclic AMP and PKC pathways work together to afford cell regulation, including the regulation of gene expression, through novel areas of crosstalk.",0.028806086809288974,glove,pmean
1,1,10359,Radiocarbon and stable carbon analysis of dissolved methane and carbon dioxide from the profile of a raised peat bog,"We developed and tested a new method to separate CO2 and CH4 from bulk gas samples for radiocarbon  and stable-carbon analysis that utilizes zeolite molecular sieve. To validate the technique, tests were performed using a suite of standard gases, composed of CO2 and CH4 of distinctly different isotopic composition. We employed the method to investigate the carbon isotopic composition of samples of dissolved CO2 and CH4 collected in situ from the near surface to deep layers of an ombrotrophic raised peat bog. Results showed that the age of both the CO2 and CH4 components of the dissolved gases increased with depth from ~ 0–300 BP at 0.25 m to ~ 4000 BP at 4 m. CH4 was mainly similar or slightly older in age compared to CO2, with the greatest difference in ages occurring at 1 m depth where CH4 was older by 430-615 years. The &#948;13C values of CO2 increased with depth from -12.4 ‰ and -8.0 ‰ at 0.25 m to +6.9 ‰ and +8.3 ‰ at 4 m, whereas the &#948;13C of CH4 stayed in the range -58.4 ‰ to -70.6 ‰. The 14C results from the deepest layers are consistent with a similar source for both gases. 14C ages for the CO2 component were younger compared to CH4, within the shallower depths of the peat bog (&#8804; 1 m) and demonstrate the incorporation of acrotelm-derived respired CO2 into the catotelm.",54634,"An airborne geophysical survey of part of west Dyfed, South Wales, and some related ground surveys","A detailed airborne geophysical survey has been made of
part of west Dyfed at a flying height of 75 m with
magnetic, electromagnetic (VLF-EM) and radiometric
equipment mounted in a helicopter. The area of 670 km2
includes the Precambrian anticlines of St David’s and
Hayscastle, the Fishguard, Sealyham and Trefgarne
volcanic groups, and the adjacent Lower Palaeozoic
sediments with associated basic intrusions.
Ground geophysical surveys were carried out at 33
localities to confirm the nature and the sources of the airborne
anomalies, and a geological examination was also
made at selected localities. Rock samples were collected
for petrographical examination and physical property
determinations. A regional gravity survey was also carried
out.
Some details of the geophysical methods and data
presentation are included together with a map at a scale of
1:50 000 summarising the main results obtained from interpretations
of the airborne geophysical surveys.
The aeromagnetic data clearly show the distribution of
the Precambrian rocks, the numerous dolerite intrusions,
and some of the pillow lavas associated with the Fishguard
Volcanic Group. This distribution generally confirms the
outcrop pattern based on geological mapping. The
magnetic data are likely to be more reliable for mapping
on a more detailed scale, due to the extensive drift cover
which hinders geological mapping in many places, and
they have also revealed some large scale structures, in-
The airborne VLF anomalies are most obvious at
lithological boundaries with large resistivity contrasts
such as the Precambrian/Lower Palaeozoic sediment and
dolerite/sediment contacts. The radiometric data provide
little obvious additional information.
Although the west Dyfed area has no significant mining
history, some exploration activity has taken place there in
recent years (Allen, Cooper and others 1985; Cameron
and others, 1984; Brown and others, 1987). One of the
main restrictions on exploration has been the lack of rock
exposure in much of the inland area and the airborne
geophysical survey was undertaken as partial compensation
for this.",0.020940167811959176,8764186,The formation of valley-wall rock glaciers,"In recent years, the study of rock glaciers has increased remarkably. Substantive
progress has been made, particularly in understanding the formation of rock
glaciers that have developed adjacent to existing or former valley or cirque
glaciers, However, our understanding of valley-wall rock glaciers that are
located at the base of talus slopes remains scant. Published work exhibits little
consensus on the formation of valley-wall rock glaciers and several hypotheses
remain under vigorous debate. The major objective of the research reported in
this thesis has been to test the generality and feasibility of seven major models
of valley-wall rock glacier formation using both empirical and theoretical
evidence. The primary conclusion is that only one of these models, the
segregation ice model, emerges as a general model of valley-wall rock glacier
genesis. The model assumes that a thin layer or several thin layers of
segregated ice are overlain by interstitially frozen sediments and an unfrozen
mantle of coarse debris. A wide range of empirical and theoretical findings are
shown to be consistent with the implications of the segregation ice model.
Detailed observations on the morphology, sedimentology and distribution of
active, inactive and relict valley-wall rock glaciers studied in Switzerland,
northern Norway and Scotland provided a range of findings that support this
model. Theoretical evidence was obtained by modelling a number of different
density models that reflect different distribution of internal ice by applying a
simple laminar flow equation to field measurements. Although only the
segregation ice model appears to be valid at a general level, the possibility
cannot be excluded of alternative modes of valley-wall rock glacier formation
under particular circumstances. Snow avalanching, deformation of snowbank
or matrix ice, and basal sliding under conditions of high hydrostatic pressure all
constitute possible contributing mechanisms of formation and movement in
particular cases.",0.02257540941908553,7375664,Aspects of speleogenesis in the Carboniferous limestone of North Derbyshire,"Karstification of the Carboniferous Limestone of the northern part of the Derbyshire limestone outcrop began to a limited extent prior to deposition of the Namurian, and continued in some areas with the development of a hydrothermal karst system during the mineralisation phases of the Permo-Triassic.
Extensive cavernisation  by allogenic  streams and by percolating meteoric water began after the final stripping of the cover of younger rocks during the late Tertiary, and the cave systems were extended and modified throughout the Pleistocene.  A complex series of erosional events, apparently related to successive glacial phases, gave rise to a series of abandoned cave levels in some areas.
The cavities produced during the Permo-Triassic were of importance in determining the nature and orientation of the later karst drainage systems.  Where such pre-existing cavity systems failed to correspond with the hydraulic gradients of the Pleistocene, bedding controlled tube networks developed at preferred horizons in the limestone, often where a fossil horizon gave a relatively higher primary permeability and an underlying clay ‘wayboard’ arrested downward percolation.
Interbedded impermeable horizons are important in the development of perched groundwater areas.  Where such horizons have been breached they often form the upper limits of large caverns, since oxidation of sulphide minerals which they contain has locally increased the aggressiveness of circulating groundwater.
The concentration of large cave systems near the margins of the present outcrop suggests that stripping of the cover during the late Tertiary occurred fast, and was completed prior to the establishment of significant hydraulic gradients within the limestone.",0.023330961253574367,5313,Isolation of novel extreme-tolerant cyanobacteria from a rock-dwelling microbial community by using exposure to low Earth orbit.,"Many cyanobacteria are known to tolerate environmental extremes. Motivated by an interest in selecting cyanobacteria for applications in space, we launched rocks from a limestone cliff in Beer, Devon, United Kingdom, containing an epilithic and endolithic rock-dwelling community of cyanobacteria into low Earth orbit (LEO) at a height of approximately 300 kilometers. The community was exposed for 10 days to isolate cyanobacteria that can survive exposure to the extreme radiation and desiccating conditions associated with space. Culture-independent (16S rRNA) and culture-dependent methods showed that the cyanobacterial community was composed of Pleurocapsales, Oscillatoriales, and Chroococcales. A single cyanobacterium, a previously uncharacterized extremophile, was isolated after exposure to LEO. We were able to isolate the cyanobacterium from the limestone cliff after exposing the rock-dwelling community to desiccation and vacuum (0.7 x 10-3kPa) in the laboratory. The ability of the organism to survive the conditions in space may be linked to the formation of dense colonies. These experiments show how extreme environmental conditions, including space, can be used to select for novel microorganisms. Furthermore, it improves our knowledge of environmental tolerances of extremophilic rock-dwelling cyanobacteria.",0.02463263055949605,112230,Widespread evidence for heterogeneous accretion of the terrestrial planets and planetisimals,"The abundance and relative proportion of highly siderophile elements (HSEs) in Earth’s mantle deviate from those predicted by low-pressure equilibrium partitioning between metal and silicate during formation of the core. For many elements, high-pressure equilibration in a deep molten silicate layer (or ‘magma ocean’) may account for this discrepancy [1], but some highly siderophile element abundances demand the late addition, a ‘late veneer’, of extraterrestrial material (i.e. heterogeneous accretion) after core formation was complete [2]. Siderophile elements in smaller asteroidal bodies will not be affected by high-pressure metal-silicate equilibration and so, with highly efficient core formation [3] and if a ‘late veneer’ is absent, significant differences in the proportions of HSEs can be anticipated. Here we present new HSE abundance and 187Os/188Os isotope data for basaltic meteorites, the HEDs (howardites, eucrites and diogenites thought to sample the asteroid 4 Vesta), anomalous eucrites (considered to be from distinct Vesta-like parent bodies) angrites and aubrites (from unidentified parent bodies) and SNCs (thought to be from Mars). Our data, taken with those for lunar rocks [4], demonstrate that these igneous meteorites all formed from mantle sources that possessed chondritic (i.e. primitive solar system) elemental and isotope compositions, indicating that late accretion is not unique to Earth, but is a common feature of differentiated planets and asteroidal bodies. Variations in the total HSE abundance suggest that the proportion of ‘late veneer’ added is a simple consequence of the size of each body (cross-section and/or gravitational-attraction), and may account for the volatile element budget, and the oxidationstate of Earth, Mars, the Moon and Vesta.",0.024947761682340697,glove,pmean
