0,9632495,Intracellular mechanisms underlying the nicotinic enhancement of LTP in the rat dentate gyrus,"We have previously shown that activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the rat dentate gyrus in vitro via activation of α7 nAChR. In the present studies, mechanisms underlying the acute and chronic nicotinic enhancement of LTP were examined. In particular, the involvement of activation of intracellular kinases was examined using selective kinase antagonists, and the effects of enhancing cholinergic function with positive allosteric modulators of the α7 nAChR and with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors were also investigated. Activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) was found to be involved in the induction of the acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP, although not control LTP. In contrast, activation of the tyrosine kinase Src, Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, Janus kinase 2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase was not involved in the acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP, although Src activation was necessary for control LTP. Moreover, activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase was involved in the acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP to a much lesser extent than in control LTP. Chronic nicotine enhancement of LTP was found to be dependent on PKA, ERK and Src kinases. Acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP was occluded by chronic nicotine treatment. The positive allosteric modulator PNU-120596 was found to strongly reduce the threshold for nicotinic enhancement of LTP, an affect mediated via the α7 nAChR as it was blocked by the selective antagonist methyllycaconitine. The AChE inhibitors tacrine and physostigmine enhanced control LTP.",9632495,Intracellular mechanisms underlying the nicotinic enhancement of LTP in the rat dentate gyrus,"We have previously shown that activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the rat dentate gyrus in vitro via activation of α7 nAChR.

A recent study identified the novel small molecule R406 as a selective inhibitor of Syk. Objectives: The present study evaluates the role of Syk in human platelets using the novel inhibitor R406. Methods: Agonist-induced GPVI and CLEC-2 signaling were assessed using aggregometry, immunoprecipitation and western blotting to determine the effects of R406 on platelet activation. Results: We demonstrate R406 to be a powerful inhibitor of Syk in human platelets. R406 abrogated shape change and aggregation induced by activation of GPVI and CLEC-2, and reduced platelet spreading on fibrinogen. The inhibitory effect of R406 was associated with inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling proteins that lay downstream of Syk for all three receptors, including PLCc2.Strikingly, R406 markedly inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of CLEC-2 and Syk downstream of CLEC-2 activation,whereas phosphorylation of Syk downstream of GPVI and integrin aIIbb3 was unaffected. Conclusions: The inhibitory effect of R406 provides direct evidence of a role for Syk in GPVI, CLEC-2 and integrin aIIbb3 signaling in human platelets. Further, the results demonstrate a critical role for Syk in mediating tyrosine phosphorylation of CLEC-2,suggesting a novel model in which both Src and Syk kinases mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of the C-type lectin receptor leading to platelet activation.",0.04861931825844534,5222960,an investigation into the role of neurotransmitter receptors in the function of human immune cells,"The interaction between the nervous and immune system is well documented, although is still not fully understood - particularly the impact of neurotransmitter receptors on immune cell function. 5-HT\(_3\)A receptor expression was identified on activated regulatory T cells (Treg) but not on effector T cells. Incubation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with the 5-HT\(_3\) receptor agonist DDP733 and the positive allosteric modulator 5-chloroindole increased the percentage of CD25+FoxP3+ lymphoyctes (Treg phenotype). Proliferation of PBMC was inhibited by DDP733 plus 5-chloroindole indicating functional impact by the 5-HT\(_3\) receptor. The GPR55 receptor was also expressed by human T cells. The GPR55 agonist lysophosphatidylinositol increased cell viability by preventing apoptosis. However, the induced response was not blocked by the GPR55 receptor antagonist cannabidiol casting doubt over the GPR55 receptor mediating the response. Cannabidiol was demonstrated to have a pro-apoptotic effect in its own right, although whether this effect is mediated by GPR55 or the CB2 cannabinoid receptor is unknown. Further experiments are required to elucidate the role of the 5-HT\(_3\)A receptor in lymphocyte function and the mechanism responsible for the immunoprotective role of lysophosphatidylinositol.",0.05992725885164485,2809201,"Xanthine oxidoreductase promotes the inflammatory state of mononuclear phagocytes through effects on chemokine expression, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma sumoylation, and HIF-1 alpha","The protective effects of pharmacological inhibitors of xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) have implicated XOR in many inflammatory diseases. Nonetheless, the role played by XOR during inflammation is poorly understood. We previously observed that inhibition of XOR within the inflammatory mononuclear phagocytes (MNP) prevented neutrophil recruitment during adoptive transfer demonstrating the role of XOR in MNP-mediated neutrophil recruitment. To further explore the role of XOR in the inflammatory state of MNP, we studied MNP isolated from inflammatory lungs combined with analyses of MNP cell lines. We demonstrated that XOR activity was increased in inflammatory MNP following insufflation of Th-1 cytokines in vivo and that activity was specifically increased by MNP differentiation. Inhibition of XOR reduced levels of CINC-1 secreted by MNP. Expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) in purified rat lung MNP and MNP cell lines reflected both the presence of PPAR gamma isoforms and PPAR gamma SUMOylation, and XOR inhibitors increased levels of SUMO-PPAR gamma in MNP cell lines. Both ectopic overexpression of XOR cDNA and uric acid supplementation reduced SUMO-PPAR gamma in MNP cells. Levels of the M2 markers CD36, CD206, and arginase-1 were modulated by uric acid and oxonic acid, whereas siRNA to SUMO-1 or PIAS-1 also reduced arginase-1 in RAW264.7 cells. We also observed that HIF-1 alpha was increased by XOR inhibitors in inflammatory MNP and in MNP cell lines. These data demonstrate that XOR promotes the inflammatory state of MNP through effects on chemokine expression, PPAR gamma SUMOylation, and HIF-1 alpha and suggest that strategies for inhibiting XOR may be valuable in modulating lung inflammatory disorders.",0.06151258835929818,31027,Characterization of glutamate-gated chloride channels in the pharynx of wild-type and mutant Caenorhabditis elegans delineates the role of the subunit GluCl-α2 in the function of the native receptor,"Glutamate-gated chloride (GluCl) channels are the site of action of the anthelmintic ivermectin. Previously, the Xenopus laevis oocyte expression system has been used to characterize GluCl channels cloned from Caenorhabditis elegans. However, information on the native, pharmacologically relevant receptors is lacking. Here, we have used a quantitative pharmacological approach and intracellular recording techniques of C. elegans pharynx to characterize them. 

The glutamate response was a rapidly desensitizing, reversible, chloride-dependent depolarization (EC50 = 166 muM), only weakly antagonized by picrotoxin. The order of potency of agonists was ibotenate > L-glutamate > kainate = quisqualate. Ivermectin potently and irreversibly depolarized the muscle (EC50 = 2.7 nM). No further depolarization was seen with coapplication of maximal glutamate during the maximal ivermectin response, indicating that ivermectin depolarizes the muscle by the same ionic mechanism as glutamate (i.e., chloride). 

The potency of ivermectin on the pharynx was greater than at any of the GluCl subunits expressed in X. laevis oocytes. This effect of ivermectin was abolished in the mutant avr-15, which lacks a functional GluCl-alpha (2) subunit. However, a chloride-dependent, nondesensitizing response to glutamate persisted. Therefore, the GluCl-alpha (2) subunit confers ivermectin sensitivity and a high-affinity desensitizing glutamate response on the native pharyngeal GluCl receptor.",0.06289791925216226
1,10359,Radiocarbon and stable carbon analysis of dissolved methane and carbon dioxide from the profile of a raised peat bog,"We developed and tested a new method to separate CO2 and CH4 from bulk gas samples for radiocarbon  and stable-carbon analysis that utilizes zeolite molecular sieve. To validate the technique, tests were performed using a suite of standard gases, composed of CO2 and CH4 of distinctly different isotopic composition. We employed the method to investigate the carbon isotopic composition of samples of dissolved CO2 and CH4 collected in situ from the near surface to deep layers of an ombrotrophic raised peat bog. Results showed that the age of both the CO2 and CH4 components of the dissolved gases increased with depth from ~ 0–300 BP at 0.25 m to ~ 4000 BP at 4 m. CH4 was mainly similar or slightly older in age compared to CO2, with the greatest difference in ages occurring at 1 m depth where CH4 was older by 430-615 years. The &#948;13C values of CO2 increased with depth from -12.4 ‰ and -8.0 ‰ at 0.25 m to +6.9 ‰ and +8.3 ‰ at 4 m, whereas the &#948;13C of CH4 stayed in the range -58.4 ‰ to -70.6 ‰. The 14C results from the deepest layers are consistent with a similar source for both gases. 14C ages for the CO2 component were younger compared to CH4, within the shallower depths of the peat bog (&#8804; 1 m) and demonstrate the incorporation of acrotelm-derived respired CO2 into the catotelm.",9543939,<i>E</i> centers in ternary Si<sub>1-<i>x-y</i></sub>Ge<sub><i>x</i></sub>Sn<sub><i>y</i></sub> random alloys,"Density functional theory calculations are used to study the association of arsenic (As) atoms to lattice vacancies and the formation of As-vacancy pairs, known as E centers, in the random Si0.375Ge0.5Sn0.125 alloy. The local environments are described by 32-atom special quasirandom structures that represent random Si1-x-yGexSny alloys. It is predicted that the nearest-neighbor environment will exert a strong influence on the stability of E centers in ternary Si0.375Ge0.5Sn0.125.",0.03817037109870114,1395050,"HREM studies of intergrowths in Sr<sub>2</sub>[Sr<sub>n</sub><sub>-</sub><sub>1</sub>Ti<sub>n</sub>O<sub>3n</sub><sub>+</sub><sub>1</sub>] Ruddlesden-Popper
phases synthesized by mechanochemical activation","A mechanochemical activation route has been applied in order to obtain the n=1–4 and &#8734; members of the Sr2[Srn−1TinO3n+1] Ruddlesden–
Popper series from different (n+1)SrO:nTiO2 mixtures. The mechanosynthesis of SrTiO3 and Sr2TiO4 was observed during the milling process
from the initial stoichiometric mixture, but in the cases of the n=2–4 members, a subsequent thermal treatment was needed. The synthesis
protocol of Sr3Ti2O7 has been greatly improved and this compound can be isolated as a single, crystalline phase after annealing at 800&#176;C. In the
case of Sr4Ti3O10 and Sr5Ti4O13, the formation temperature was also decreased, but members with n=3 and 4 could not be isolated. Detailed
investigations using electron microscopy methods (TEM, HREM and SAED) were carried out in the samples corresponding to n=2–4. Although
a single ordered Sr3Ti2O7 structure is dominant in the sample corresponding to n=2, a few intergrowths of other Ruddlesden–Popper phases were
observed. In the cases of n=3 and 4, the intergrowths of Ruddlesden–Popper phases are more frequent than in the n=2 composition and are
randomly distributed in the sample. The more frequent occurrence of such stacking faults, with increasing n value, leads to a somewhat disordered
layer stacking sequence.",0.04714201825057429,106585,Contrasting wetland CH<sub>4</sub> emission responses to simulated glacial atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> in temperate bogs and fens,"Wetlands were the largest source of atmospheric methane (CH4) during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), but the sensitivity of this source to exceptionally low atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2]) at the time has not been examined experimentally. We tested the hypothesis that LGM atmospheric [CO2] reduced CH4 emissions as a consequence of decreased photosynthate allocation to the rhizosphere.


We exposed minerotrophic fen and ombrotrophic bog peatland mesocosms to simulated LGM (c. 200 ppm) or ambient (c. 400 ppm) [CO2] over 21 months (n = 8 per treatment) and measured gaseous CH4 flux, pore water dissolved CH4 and volatile fatty acid (VFA; an indicator of plant carbon supply to the rhizosphere) concentrations.


Cumulative CH4 flux from fen mesocosms was suppressed by 29% (P 4] by c. 50% (P 2], variables that remained unaffected in bog mesocosms. VFA analysis indicated that changes in plant root exudates were not the driving mechanism behind these results.


Our data suggest that the LGM [CO2] suppression of wetland CH4 emissions is contingent on trophic status. The heterogeneous response may be attributable to differences in species assemblage that influence the dominant CH4 production pathway, rhizosphere supplemented photosynthesis and CH4 oxidation.",0.05040548779273768,5193281,"Detection of the 2(1,1) - 2(1,2) rotational emission line of HDO in the Orion Molecular Cloud","The 2(1,1) - 2(1,2) rotational transition of HDO has been detected towards the KL position at the center of the OMC-1 at a velocity VLSR of +5.5(± 1.3)km s-1, corresponding to emission from the central core. This measurement is combined with previous estimates of the H2O abundance close to KL to obtain an [HDO]:[H2O] ratio of 9.5(±1.5) x 10-3. The systematic model-dependence of this ratio is examined in some detail, to show how reliably it may be used to obtain a radial gradient of [HDO]:[H2O], and hence of [D]:[H], within the Galaxy.",0.08008400114359693,5193286,"J = 4→3 HCN observations of M17SW, DR 21(OH), W51 and NGC 6334","We report observations of NGC 6334N, Ml7SW, W 51 and DR2l(OH) in the J = 4→3 transition of HCN at 354GHz.
