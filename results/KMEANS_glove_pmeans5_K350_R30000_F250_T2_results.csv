0,9632495,Intracellular mechanisms underlying the nicotinic enhancement of LTP in the rat dentate gyrus,"We have previously shown that activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the rat dentate gyrus in vitro via activation of α7 nAChR. In the present studies, mechanisms underlying the acute and chronic nicotinic enhancement of LTP were examined. In particular, the involvement of activation of intracellular kinases was examined using selective kinase antagonists, and the effects of enhancing cholinergic function with positive allosteric modulators of the α7 nAChR and with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors were also investigated. Activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) was found to be involved in the induction of the acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP, although not control LTP. In contrast, activation of the tyrosine kinase Src, Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, Janus kinase 2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase was not involved in the acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP, although Src activation was necessary for control LTP. Moreover, activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase was involved in the acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP to a much lesser extent than in control LTP. Chronic nicotine enhancement of LTP was found to be dependent on PKA, ERK and Src kinases. Acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP was occluded by chronic nicotine treatment. The positive allosteric modulator PNU-120596 was found to strongly reduce the threshold for nicotinic enhancement of LTP, an affect mediated via the α7 nAChR as it was blocked by the selective antagonist methyllycaconitine. The AChE inhibitors tacrine and physostigmine enhanced control LTP.",9632495,Intracellular mechanisms underlying the nicotinic enhancement of LTP in the rat dentate gyrus,"We have previously shown that activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the rat dentate gyrus in vitro via activation of α7 nAChR.

This phenomenon, known as pharmacological preconditioning, decreases infarct size and increases the functional recovery of the intact heart. The role of protein kinases and ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP) in phenylephrine preconditioning was investigated in isolated ventricular myocytes using whole cell patch clamp, western blotting, fluorescence imaging and measurement of contractile activity. The role of PKC isoforms was examined using isoform-specific PKC activator and inhibitor peptides.
Preconditioning with phenylephrine increased the contractile recovery of isolated ventricular myocytes following simulated ischaemia and reperfusion, and this was also correlated with an improvement in calcium homeostasis during reperfusion. The protective effect of phenylephrine preconditioning on contractile recovery was abolished by inhibition of α1-adrenoceptors, PKC or KATP. We observed a sustained activation of PKCε and δ in response to phenylephrine preconditioning, and identified a protective role for PKCε. PKCδ was required for phenylephrine preconditioning but also increased reperfusion injury. CaMKK, AMPK and p38 MAPK were all required for phenylephrine preconditioning, and activation of AMPK by phenylephrine preconditioning required PKCδ. However, both JNK and ERK appear not to be involved in the protective effect.
Inhibition of sarcolemmal KATP channels (sarcKATP) or mitochondrial KATP channels (mitoKATP) prevented preconditioning. Peak sarcKATP current activated by metabolic inhibition was increased following phenylephrine preconditioning and inhibition of PKCδ, AMPK or p38 MAPK was sufficient to prevent the increase in current.
Increased sarcKATP current can enhance hyperpolarisation of the resting membrane potential, and may be responsible for the observed decrease in calcium loading and improved contractile recovery of phenylephrine preconditioned ventricular myocytes following ischaemia and reperfusion.",0.02531387616738745,19237,The tyrosine phosphatase CD148 is an essential positive regulator of platelet activation and thrombosis,"Platelets play a fundamental role in hemostasis and thrombosis. They are also involved in pathologic conditions resulting from blocked blood vessels, including myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. Platelet adhesion, activation, and aggregation at sites of vascular injury are regulated by a diverse repertoire of tyrosine kinase–linked and G protein–coupled receptors. Src family kinases (SFKs) play a central role in initiating and propagating signaling from several platelet surface receptors; however, the underlying mechanism of how SFK activity is regulated in platelets remains unclear. CD148 is the only receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase identified in platelets to date. In the present study, we show that mutant mice lacking CD148 exhibited a bleeding tendency and defective arterial thrombosis. Basal SFK activity was found to be markedly reduced in CD148-deficient platelets, resulting in a global hyporesponsiveness to agonists that signal through SFKs, including collagen and fibrinogen. G protein–coupled receptor responses to thrombin and other agonists were also marginally reduced. These results highlight CD148 as a global regulator of platelet activation and a novel antithrombotic drug target",0.025417376013960213,2752345,Hypomorphic mutation of PDK1 suppresses tumorigenesis in PTEN(+/-) mice,"Many cancers possess elevated levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, the second messenger that induces activation of the protein kinases PKB/Akt and S6K and thereby stimulates cell proliferation, growth, and survival [[1] and [2]]. The importance of this pathway in tumorigenesis has been highlighted by the finding that PTEN, the lipid phosphatase that breaks down PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 to PtdIns(4,5)P2, is frequently mutated in human cancer [[3] and [4]].Cells lacking PTEN possess elevated levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, PKB, and S6K activity [[5], [6], [7] and [8]] and heterozygous PTEN+/− mice develop a variety of tumors [[9], [10] and [11]]. Knockout of PKBα in PTEN-deficient cells reduces aggressive growth and promotes apoptosis [12], whereas treatment of PTEN+/− mice with rapamycin, an inhibitor of the activation of S6K, reduces neoplasia [13]. We explored the importance of PDK1, the protein kinase that activates PKB and S6K [14], in mediating tumorigenesis caused by the deletion of PTEN. We demonstrate that reducing the expression of PDK1 in PTEN+/− mice, markedly protects these animals from developing a wide range of tumors. Our findings provide genetic evidence that PDK1 is a key effector in mediating neoplasia resulting from loss of PTEN and also validate PDK1 as a promising anticancer target for the prevention of tumors that possess elevated PKB and S6K activity.",0.0283849993062103,282289,Novel areas of crosstalk between the cyclic AMP and PKC signalling pathways,"Mediation of biological functions occurs via tightly regulated signal transduction pathways. These complex cascades often employ crosstalk with other signalling pathways to exert strict control to allow for correct cellular responses. The cyclic AMP signalling pathway is involved in a wide range of cellular processes which require tight control, including cell proliferation and differentiation, metabolism and inflammation. Protein Kinase C (PKC) signalling is also involved in the regulation of many biological functions, due to the wide range of PKC isoforms, and there is emerging evidence that there are critical points of crosstalk between these two central signalling pathways. The aims of this research, therefore, are to identify the molecular basis underlying this pivotal cross-communication.

The identification of the complex formed by Receptor for activated C Kinase 1 (RACK1), a scaffold protein for PKC, and the cyclic AMP-specific phosphodiesterase PDE4D5 demonstrated a potential area of crosstalk between the cyclic AMP and PKC signalling pathways although the function of the complex remained largely unknown. In this thesis I have outlined a role for RACK1 binding to PDE4D5 to control the enzymatic activity of the phosphodiesterase. Although RACK1 does not affect the intracellular localisation of PDE4D5, it does afford structural stability to PDE4D5, providing protection against denaturation. Furthermore, interaction with RACK1 facilitates high affinity binding of PDE4D5 to cyclic AMP and increases phosphodiesterase sensitivity to inhibition by rolipram, a PDE4-specific inhibitor that is a therapeutic treatment for depression and Alzheimer’s disease. Additionally, RACK1-bound PDE4D5 was found to be activated by PKCα, providing a route of negative regulation by PKC on cyclic AMP in HEK293 cells. 

The discovery of EPAC (Exchange Protein directly Activated by Cyclic AMP) has opened up the field of cyclic AMP research, providing an alternative route for the cyclic AMP signalling originally thought to occur solely through Protein Kinase A (PKA). Recent investigations have linked cyclic AMP signalling via EPAC to the control of inflammation, through the induction of Suppressor of Cytokine Signalling 3 (SOCS-3) to inhibit IL-6 signalling. Here I have further delineated this pathway in COS1 to show that induction of SOCS-3 by EPAC requires phospholipase C (PLC) ε. Investigation into downstream effectors of PLC action lead to the identification of PKCα and PKCδ as essential components of this pathway, further elucidating a mechanism by which cyclic AMP can affect inflammation and revealing a point of crosstalk between the two signalling pathways.

Further elaborating on the identification of PKC isoforms α and δ as crucial components in the control of cytokine signalling by cyclic AMP via EPAC, investigations into the effect of cyclic AMP on PKC α and δ activation and autophosphorylation, and on downstream effectors, were carried out. It was revealed that cyclic AMP had no influence on PKCδ activity, although a role for cyclic AMP signalling through EPAC on the activation and autophosphorylation of PKCα was identified. Additionally, phosphorylation of the downstream kinase ERK was found to occur independently of PKC activation and required the presence of EPAC1 in COS1 cells.

The work presented in this thesis therefore begins to delineate a novel pathway in which the cyclic AMP and PKC pathways work together to afford cell regulation, including the regulation of gene expression, through novel areas of crosstalk.",0.028806086809288978
1,10359,Radiocarbon and stable carbon analysis of dissolved methane and carbon dioxide from the profile of a raised peat bog,"We developed and tested a new method to separate CO2 and CH4 from bulk gas samples for radiocarbon  and stable-carbon analysis that utilizes zeolite molecular sieve. To validate the technique, tests were performed using a suite of standard gases, composed of CO2 and CH4 of distinctly different isotopic composition. We employed the method to investigate the carbon isotopic composition of samples of dissolved CO2 and CH4 collected in situ from the near surface to deep layers of an ombrotrophic raised peat bog. Results showed that the age of both the CO2 and CH4 components of the dissolved gases increased with depth from ~ 0–300 BP at 0.25 m to ~ 4000 BP at 4 m. CH4 was mainly similar or slightly older in age compared to CO2, with the greatest difference in ages occurring at 1 m depth where CH4 was older by 430-615 years. The &#948;13C values of CO2 increased with depth from -12.4 ‰ and -8.0 ‰ at 0.25 m to +6.9 ‰ and +8.3 ‰ at 4 m, whereas the &#948;13C of CH4 stayed in the range -58.4 ‰ to -70.6 ‰. The 14C results from the deepest layers are consistent with a similar source for both gases. 14C ages for the CO2 component were younger compared to CH4, within the shallower depths of the peat bog (&#8804; 1 m) and demonstrate the incorporation of acrotelm-derived respired CO2 into the catotelm.",54634,"An airborne geophysical survey of part of west Dyfed, South Wales, and some related ground surveys","A detailed airborne geophysical survey has been made of
part of west Dyfed at a flying height of 75 m with
magnetic, electromagnetic (VLF-EM) and radiometric
equipment mounted in a helicopter. The area of 670 km2
includes the Precambrian anticlines of St David’s and
Hayscastle, the Fishguard, Sealyham and Trefgarne
volcanic groups, and the adjacent Lower Palaeozoic
sediments with associated basic intrusions.
Ground geophysical surveys were carried out at 33
localities to confirm the nature and the sources of the airborne
anomalies, and a geological examination was also
made at selected localities. Rock samples were collected
for petrographical examination and physical property
determinations. A regional gravity survey was also carried
out.
Some details of the geophysical methods and data
presentation are included together with a map at a scale of
1:50 000 summarising the main results obtained from interpretations
of the airborne geophysical surveys.
The aeromagnetic data clearly show the distribution of
the Precambrian rocks, the numerous dolerite intrusions,
and some of the pillow lavas associated with the Fishguard
Volcanic Group. This distribution generally confirms the
outcrop pattern based on geological mapping. The
magnetic data are likely to be more reliable for mapping
on a more detailed scale, due to the extensive drift cover
which hinders geological mapping in many places, and
they have also revealed some large scale structures, in-
The airborne VLF anomalies are most obvious at
lithological boundaries with large resistivity contrasts
such as the Precambrian/Lower Palaeozoic sediment and
dolerite/sediment contacts. The radiometric data provide
little obvious additional information.
Although the west Dyfed area has no significant mining
history, some exploration activity has taken place there in
recent years (Allen, Cooper and others 1985; Cameron
and others, 1984; Brown and others, 1987). One of the
main restrictions on exploration has been the lack of rock
exposure in much of the inland area and the airborne
geophysical survey was undertaken as partial compensation
for this.",0.020940167811959176,8764186,The formation of valley-wall rock glaciers,"In recent years, the study of rock glaciers has increased remarkably. Substantive
progress has been made, particularly in understanding the formation of rock
glaciers that have developed adjacent to existing or former valley or cirque
glaciers, However, our understanding of valley-wall rock glaciers that are
located at the base of talus slopes remains scant. Published work exhibits little
consensus on the formation of valley-wall rock glaciers and several hypotheses
remain under vigorous debate. The major objective of the research reported in
this thesis has been to test the generality and feasibility of seven major models
of valley-wall rock glacier formation using both empirical and theoretical
evidence. The primary conclusion is that only one of these models, the
segregation ice model, emerges as a general model of valley-wall rock glacier
genesis. The model assumes that a thin layer or several thin layers of
segregated ice are overlain by interstitially frozen sediments and an unfrozen
mantle of coarse debris. A wide range of empirical and theoretical findings are
shown to be consistent with the implications of the segregation ice model.
Detailed observations on the morphology, sedimentology and distribution of
active, inactive and relict valley-wall rock glaciers studied in Switzerland,
northern Norway and Scotland provided a range of findings that support this
model. Theoretical evidence was obtained by modelling a number of different
density models that reflect different distribution of internal ice by applying a
simple laminar flow equation to field measurements. Although only the
segregation ice model appears to be valid at a general level, the possibility
cannot be excluded of alternative modes of valley-wall rock glacier formation
under particular circumstances. Snow avalanching, deformation of snowbank
or matrix ice, and basal sliding under conditions of high hydrostatic pressure all
constitute possible contributing mechanisms of formation and movement in
particular cases.",0.022575409419085535,7375664,Aspects of speleogenesis in the Carboniferous limestone of North Derbyshire,"Karstification of the Carboniferous Limestone of the northern part of the Derbyshire limestone outcrop began to a limited extent prior to deposition of the Namurian, and continued in some areas with the development of a hydrothermal karst system during the mineralisation phases of the Permo-Triassic.
Extensive cavernisation  by allogenic  streams and by percolating meteoric water began after the final stripping of the cover of younger rocks during the late Tertiary, and the cave systems were extended and modified throughout the Pleistocene.  A complex series of erosional events, apparently related to successive glacial phases, gave rise to a series of abandoned cave levels in some areas.
The cavities produced during the Permo-Triassic were of importance in determining the nature and orientation of the later karst drainage systems.  Where such pre-existing cavity systems failed to correspond with the hydraulic gradients of the Pleistocene, bedding controlled tube networks developed at preferred horizons in the limestone, often where a fossil horizon gave a relatively higher primary permeability and an underlying clay ‘wayboard’ arrested downward percolation.
Interbedded impermeable horizons are important in the development of perched groundwater areas.  Where such horizons have been breached they often form the upper limits of large caverns, since oxidation of sulphide minerals which they contain has locally increased the aggressiveness of circulating groundwater.
The concentration of large cave systems near the margins of the present outcrop suggests that stripping of the cover during the late Tertiary occurred fast, and was completed prior to the establishment of significant hydraulic gradients within the limestone.",0.023330961253574367,5313,Isolation of novel extreme-tolerant cyanobacteria from a rock-dwelling microbial community by using exposure to low Earth orbit.,"Many cyanobacteria are known to tolerate environmental extremes. Motivated by an interest in selecting cyanobacteria for applications in space, we launched rocks from a limestone cliff in Beer, Devon, United Kingdom, containing an epilithic and endolithic rock-dwelling community of cyanobacteria into low Earth orbit (LEO) at a height of approximately 300 kilometers. The community was exposed for 10 days to isolate cyanobacteria that can survive exposure to the extreme radiation and desiccating conditions associated with space. Culture-independent (16S rRNA) and culture-dependent methods showed that the cyanobacterial community was composed of Pleurocapsales, Oscillatoriales, and Chroococcales. A single cyanobacterium, a previously uncharacterized extremophile, was isolated after exposure to LEO. We were able to isolate the cyanobacterium from the limestone cliff after exposing the rock-dwelling community to desiccation and vacuum (0.7 x 10-3kPa) in the laboratory. The ability of the organism to survive the conditions in space may be linked to the formation of dense colonies. These experiments show how extreme environmental conditions, including space, can be used to select for novel microorganisms. Furthermore, it improves our knowledge of environmental tolerances of extremophilic rock-dwelling cyanobacteria.",0.02463263055949605,112230,Widespread evidence for heterogeneous accretion of the terrestrial planets and planetisimals,"The abundance and relative proportion of highly siderophile elements (HSEs) in Earth’s mantle deviate from those predicted by low-pressure equilibrium partitioning between metal and silicate during formation of the core. For many elements, high-pressure equilibration in a deep molten silicate layer (or ‘magma ocean’) may account for this discrepancy [1], but some highly siderophile element abundances demand the late addition, a ‘late veneer’, of extraterrestrial material (i.e. heterogeneous accretion) after core formation was complete [2]. Siderophile elements in smaller asteroidal bodies will not be affected by high-pressure metal-silicate equilibration and so, with highly efficient core formation [3] and if a ‘late veneer’ is absent, significant differences in the proportions of HSEs can be anticipated. Here we present new HSE abundance and 187Os/188Os isotope data for basaltic meteorites, the HEDs (howardites, eucrites and diogenites thought to sample the asteroid 4 Vesta), anomalous eucrites (considered to be from distinct Vesta-like parent bodies) angrites and aubrites (from unidentified parent bodies) and SNCs (thought to be from Mars). Our data, taken with those for lunar rocks [4], demonstrate that these igneous meteorites all formed from mantle sources that possessed chondritic (i.e. primitive solar system) elemental and isotope compositions, indicating that late accretion is not unique to Earth, but is a common feature of differentiated planets and asteroidal bodies. Variations in the total HSE abundance suggest that the proportion of ‘late veneer’ added is a simple consequence of the size of each body (cross-section and/or gravitational-attraction), and may account for the volatile element budget, and the oxidationstate of Earth, Mars, the Moon and Vesta.",0.024947761682340697
