0,9632495,Intracellular mechanisms underlying the nicotinic enhancement of LTP in the rat dentate gyrus,"We have previously shown that activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the rat dentate gyrus in vitro via activation of α7 nAChR. In the present studies, mechanisms underlying the acute and chronic nicotinic enhancement of LTP were examined. In particular, the involvement of activation of intracellular kinases was examined using selective kinase antagonists, and the effects of enhancing cholinergic function with positive allosteric modulators of the α7 nAChR and with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors were also investigated. Activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) was found to be involved in the induction of the acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP, although not control LTP. In contrast, activation of the tyrosine kinase Src, Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, Janus kinase 2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase was not involved in the acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP, although Src activation was necessary for control LTP. Moreover, activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase was involved in the acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP to a much lesser extent than in control LTP. Chronic nicotine enhancement of LTP was found to be dependent on PKA, ERK and Src kinases. Acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP was occluded by chronic nicotine treatment. The positive allosteric modulator PNU-120596 was found to strongly reduce the threshold for nicotinic enhancement of LTP, an affect mediated via the α7 nAChR as it was blocked by the selective antagonist methyllycaconitine. The AChE inhibitors tacrine and physostigmine enhanced control LTP.",9632495,Intracellular mechanisms underlying the nicotinic enhancement of LTP in the rat dentate gyrus,"We have previously shown that activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the rat dentate gyrus in vitro via activation of α7 nAChR.

Both agonists have also been demonstrated to stimulate proliferation, neogenesis and increased transcription potentially thourough ERK1/2 dependent pathways. ERK1/2 has been shown to play an important role in regulating pancreatic β-cell function and mass and mediating gene transcription. Therefore, this thesis aims to elucidate the mechanism by which GLP-1, via the GLP-1R, and carbachol, via Gq-coupled mAChR activation, leads to the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in the pancreatic β-cell line MIN6.
I demonstrate that both GLP-1R and mAChR stimulation mediate Ca2+-dependent ERK1/2 activation requiring the activation of the L-type VGCC. 
GLP-1 causes a sustained activation of ERK1/2 that requires continual activation of the L-type VGCC and the sustained elevation of local Ca2+ around the mouth of the channel. Importantly, ERK1/2 activation stimulated by L-type VGCCs mediated Ca2+ influx is required for GLP-1 stimulated insulin transcription. The mechanism by which the L-type VGCC signals to ERK1/2 was also investigated. I demonstrate that L-type VGCC-dependent ERK1/2 activation mediated by local Ca2+ is Ras-independent. However, a global rise in Ca2+ mediated by a depolarising stimulus is capable of mediating ERK1/2 activation by a Ras-dependent mechanism. I have also demonstrated that the down-regulation of DAG-sensitive proteins significantly inhibits GLP-1 stimulated ERK1/2 activation, but this is not thourough the down regulation or inactivation of classical or novel PKC isoforms.
 mAChR activation mediates the rapid and transient phosphorylation of ERK1/2 which is dependent upon PLC and a rise in [Ca2+]i, but independent of PKC activation. Importantly, the rise in [Ca2+]i is mediated from multiple sources including: the efflux of Ca2+ from the ER by IP3R activation, the influx of extracellular Ca2+ thourough store operated channels (SOC) and L-type VGCC activation. I provide evidence that the activation of the L-type VGCC is partially mediated by the inhibition of KATP channels via PIP2 depletion, as increasing PIP2 levels partially inhibits carbachol-stimulated increases in [Ca2+]i and ERK1/2 activation. However, carbachol stimulated ERK1/2 activation appears to have, like a depolarising stimulus, a Ras-dependent and a Rasindependent pathway mediating ERK1/2 activation, potentially due to the L-type VGCC activation initiated by carbachol.
Overall this thesis demonstrates that the L-type VGCC is a key mediator in ERK1/2 activation in β-cells. Both GLP-1 and mAChR stimulation requires the activity of the Ltype VGCC to mediate Ca2+-dependent ERK1/2 activation, and I have provided evidence that a Ras-independent Ca2+-dependent pathway leading to ERK1/2 activation is initiated within the microdomain of the L-type VGCC and can stimulate transcription.",0.027154340422787415,282350,"Biochemical investigation of phosphodiesterase type IV post-translational modification, cellular localisation and interaction with associated binding proteins","cAMP is a secondary messenger that is involved in a variety of signalling pathways through its effectors including EPAC, PKA and ion channels. cAMP signalling regulates processes such as memory, muscle contraction and inflammatory responses. PDE enzymes offer a mechanism to negatively regulate elevated cAMP levels elicited by activators of adenylyl cyclase. Studies have shown that cAMP signalling is compartmentalised through binding of PDEs to A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) that scaffold PKA regulatory subunits. 

In this study post-translational-modification of PDE4 isoforms is investigated. SUMOylation is a relatively newly identified post-translational modification that is known to regulate the structure and function of its substrates. PDE4 isoforms of the PDE4A and 4D subfamilies are SUMOylated by an E3 ligase, PIASy. SUMOylation alters the rolipram sensitivity and potentiates the PKA mediated activation of the isoforms whilst it confers protection from ERK-mediated inhibition of PDE4 activity. SUMOylation alters the association of PDE4 isoforms with binding partners like β-Arrestin, AKAP18 δ and UBC9. 

Rolipram is an archetypal PDE4 specific inhibitor. In this study it is shown that in cells expressing a GFP tagged form of PDE4A4 undergoes redistribution into accretion foci upon chronic treatment with rolipram. Data suggests that foci formation requires protein turnover and is regulated by signalling pathways such as PI3 kinase pathway, p38 MAP kinase pathway and PKC pathways. Further, the Immunomodulatory drug Thalidomide® also inhibits foci formation. 

PDE4 isoforms have isoforms specific N-terminal regions, which play a crucial role in sub-cellular localisation and protein-protein interactions. It is shown here that PDE4D5 interacts with a novel RhoGAP called ARHGAP21 which has been previously reported to bind β-arrestins. This interaction is independent of GAP activity of ARHGAP as well as PDE4 activity. Previous reports have indicated a role of β-Arrestin, PDE4 and ARHGAP21 in regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Hence complex β-Arrestin-PDE4-ARHGAP21 may play a crucial role in regulating actin dynamics.",0.02808940747189259,99719,Opposing Changes in Phosphorylation of Specific Sites in Synapsin I During Ca2-Dependent Glutamate Release in Isolated Nerve Terminals,"Synapsins are major neuronal phosphoproteins involved in regulation
of neurotransmitter release. Synapsins are well established
targets for multiple protein kinases within the nerve
terminal, yet little is known about dephosphorylation processes
involved in regulation of synapsin function. Here, we observed
a reciprocal relationship in the phosphorylation–dephosphorylation
of the established phosphorylation sites on synapsin I.
We demonstrate that, in vitro, phosphorylation sites 1, 2, and 3
of synapsin I (P-site 1 phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent
protein kinase; P-sites 2 and 3 phosphorylated by Ca2–
calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) were excellent substrates
for protein phosphatase 2A, whereas P-sites 4, 5, and 6 (phosphorylated
by mitogen-activated protein kinase) were efficiently
dephosphorylated only by Ca2–calmodulin-dependent protein
phosphatase 2B–calcineurin. In isolated nerve terminals, rapid
changes in synapsin I phosphorylation were observed after Ca2
entry, namely, a Ca2-dependent phosphorylation of P-sites 1, 2,
and 3 and a Ca2-dependent dephosphorylation of P-sites 4, 5,
and 6. Inhibition of calcineurin activity by cyclosporin A resulted in
a complete block of Ca2-dependent dephosphorylation of
P-sites 4, 5, and 6 and correlated with a prominent increase in
ionomycin-evoked glutamate release. These two opposing, rapid,
Ca2-dependent processes may play a crucial role in the modulation
of synaptic vesicle trafficking within the presynaptic terminal.",0.03140591551233696,6120974,"Scanning peptide array analysis identify overlapping binding sites for the signaling scaffold proteins, beta-arestin and RACK1 in the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase, PDE4D5","The cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase PDE4D5 can interact with the signalling scaffold proteins RACK (receptors for activated C-kinase) 1 and &#946;-arrestin. Two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation analyses showed that RACK1 and &#946;-arrestin interact with PDE4D5 in a mutually exclusive manner. Overlay studies with PDE4D5 scanning peptide array libraries showed that RACK1 and &#946;-arrestin interact at overlapping sites within the unique N-terminal region of PDE4D5 and at distinct sites within the conserved PDE4 catalytic domain. Screening scanning alanine substitution peptide arrays, coupled with mutagenesis and truncation studies, allowed definition of RACK1 and &#946;-arrestin interaction sites. Modelled on the PDE4D catalytic domain, these form distinct well-defined surface-exposed patches on helices-15–16, for RACK1, and helix-17 for &#946;-arrestin. siRNA (small interfering RNA)-mediated knockdown of RACK1 in HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney) B2 cells increased &#946;-arrestin-scaffolded PDE4D5 approx. 5-fold, increased PDE4D5 recruited to the &#946;2AR (&#946;2-adrenergic receptor) upon isoproterenol challenge approx. 4-fold and severely attenuated (approx. 4–5 fold) both isoproterenol-stimulated PKA (protein kinase A) phosphorylation of the &#946;2AR and activation of ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase). The ability of a catalytically inactive form of PDE4D5 to exert a dominant negative effect in amplifying isoproterenol-stimulated ERK activation was ablated by a mutation that blocked the interaction of PDE4D5 with &#946;-arrestin. In the present study, we show that the signalling scaffold proteins RACK1 and &#946;-arrestin compete to sequester distinct ‘pools’ of PDE4D5. In this fashion, alterations in the level of RACK1 expression may act to modulate signal transduction mediated by the &#946;2AR.",0.038432048139674824
1,10359,Radiocarbon and stable carbon analysis of dissolved methane and carbon dioxide from the profile of a raised peat bog,"We developed and tested a new method to separate CO2 and CH4 from bulk gas samples for radiocarbon  and stable-carbon analysis that utilizes zeolite molecular sieve. To validate the technique, tests were performed using a suite of standard gases, composed of CO2 and CH4 of distinctly different isotopic composition. We employed the method to investigate the carbon isotopic composition of samples of dissolved CO2 and CH4 collected in situ from the near surface to deep layers of an ombrotrophic raised peat bog. Results showed that the age of both the CO2 and CH4 components of the dissolved gases increased with depth from ~ 0–300 BP at 0.25 m to ~ 4000 BP at 4 m. CH4 was mainly similar or slightly older in age compared to CO2, with the greatest difference in ages occurring at 1 m depth where CH4 was older by 430-615 years. The &#948;13C values of CO2 increased with depth from -12.4 ‰ and -8.0 ‰ at 0.25 m to +6.9 ‰ and +8.3 ‰ at 4 m, whereas the &#948;13C of CH4 stayed in the range -58.4 ‰ to -70.6 ‰. The 14C results from the deepest layers are consistent with a similar source for both gases. 14C ages for the CO2 component were younger compared to CH4, within the shallower depths of the peat bog (&#8804; 1 m) and demonstrate the incorporation of acrotelm-derived respired CO2 into the catotelm.",1395050,"HREM studies of intergrowths in Sr<sub>2</sub>[Sr<sub>n</sub><sub>-</sub><sub>1</sub>Ti<sub>n</sub>O<sub>3n</sub><sub>+</sub><sub>1</sub>] Ruddlesden-Popper

Popper series from different (n+1)SrO:nTiO2 mixtures. The mechanosynthesis of SrTiO3 and Sr2TiO4 was observed during the milling process
from the initial stoichiometric mixture, but in the cases of the n=2–4 members, a subsequent thermal treatment was needed. The synthesis
protocol of Sr3Ti2O7 has been greatly improved and this compound can be isolated as a single, crystalline phase after annealing at 800&#176;C. In the
case of Sr4Ti3O10 and Sr5Ti4O13, the formation temperature was also decreased, but members with n=3 and 4 could not be isolated. Detailed
investigations using electron microscopy methods (TEM, HREM and SAED) were carried out in the samples corresponding to n=2–4. Although
a single ordered Sr3Ti2O7 structure is dominant in the sample corresponding to n=2, a few intergrowths of other Ruddlesden–Popper phases were
observed. In the cases of n=3 and 4, the intergrowths of Ruddlesden–Popper phases are more frequent than in the n=2 composition and are
randomly distributed in the sample. The more frequent occurrence of such stacking faults, with increasing n value, leads to a somewhat disordered
