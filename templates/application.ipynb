['Intracellular mechanisms underlying the nicotinic enhancement of LTP in the rat dentate gyrus'], 'Abstract': ['We have previously shown that activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the rat dentate gyrus in vitro via activation of α7 nAChR. In the present studies, mechanisms underlying the acute and chronic nicotinic enhancement of LTP were examined. In particular, the involvement of activation of intracellular kinases was examined using selective kinase antagonists, and the effects of enhancing cholinergic function with positive allosteric modulators of the α7 nAChR and with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors were also investigated. Activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) was found to be involved in the induction of the acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP, although not control LTP. In contrast, activation of the tyrosine kinase Src, Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, Janus kinase 2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase was not involved in the acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP, although Src activation was necessary for control LTP. Moreover, activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase was involved in the acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP to a much lesser extent than in control LTP. Chronic nicotine enhancement of LTP was found to be dependent on PKA, ERK and Src kinases. Acute nicotinic enhancement of LTP was occluded by chronic nicotine treatment.

We employed the method to investigate the carbon isotopic composition of samples of dissolved CO2 and CH4 collected in situ from the near surface to deep layers of an ombrotrophic raised peat bog. Results showed that the age of both the CO2 and CH4 components of the dissolved gases increased with depth from ~ 0–300 BP at 0.25 m to ~ 4000 BP at 4 m.

Two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation analyses showed that RACK1 and &#946;-arrestin interact with PDE4D5 in a mutually exclusive manner. Overlay studies with PDE4D5 scanning peptide array libraries showed that RACK1 and &#946;-arrestin interact at overlapping sites within the unique N-terminal region of PDE4D5 and at distinct sites within the conserved PDE4 catalytic domain. Screening scanning alanine substitution peptide arrays, coupled with mutagenesis and truncation studies, allowed definition of RACK1 and &#946;-arrestin interaction sites. Modelled on the PDE4D catalytic domain, these form distinct well-defined surface-exposed patches on helices-15–16, for RACK1, and helix-17 for &#946;-arrestin. siRNA (small interfering RNA)-mediated knockdown of RACK1 in HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney) B2 cells increased &#946;-arrestin-scaffolded PDE4D5 approx. 5-fold, increased PDE4D5 recruited to the &#946;2AR (&#946;2-adrenergic receptor) upon isoproterenol challenge approx. 4-fold and severely attenuated (approx. 4–5 fold) both isoproterenol-stimulated PKA (protein kinase A) phosphorylation of the &#946;2AR and activation of ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase).

These complex cascades often employ crosstalk with other signalling pathways to exert strict control to allow for correct cellular responses. The cyclic AMP signalling pathway is involved in a wide range of cellular processes which require tight control, including cell proliferation and differentiation, metabolism and inflammation. Protein Kinase C (PKC) signalling is also involved in the regulation of many biological functions, due to the wide range of PKC isoforms, and there is emerging evidence that there are critical points of crosstalk between these two central signalling pathways. The aims of this research, therefore, are to identify the molecular basis underlying this pivotal cross-communication.\\n\\nThe identification of the complex formed by Receptor for activated C Kinase 1 (RACK1), a scaffold protein for PKC, and the cyclic AMP-specific phosphodiesterase PDE4D5 demonstrated a potential area of crosstalk between the cyclic AMP and PKC signalling pathways although the function of the complex remained largely unknown. In this thesis I have outlined a role for RACK1 binding to PDE4D5 to control the enzymatic activity of the phosphodiesterase. Although RACK1 does not affect the intracellular localisation of PDE4D5, it does afford structural stability to PDE4D5, providing protection against denaturation. Furthermore, interaction with RACK1 facilitates high affinity binding of PDE4D5 to cyclic AMP and increases phosphodiesterase sensitivity to inhibition by rolipram, a PDE4-specific inhibitor that is a therapeutic treatment for depression and Alzheimer’s disease. Additionally, RACK1-bound PDE4D5 was found to be activated by PKCα, providing a route of negative regulation by PKC on cyclic AMP in HEK293 cells. \\n\\nThe discovery of EPAC (Exchange Protein directly Activated by Cyclic AMP) has opened up the field of cyclic AMP research, providing an alternative route for the cyclic AMP signalling originally thought to occur solely through Protein Kinase A (PKA). Recent investigations have linked cyclic AMP signalling via EPAC to the control of inflammation, through the induction of Suppressor of Cytokine Signalling 3 (SOCS-3) to inhibit IL-6 signalling. Here I have further delineated this pathway in COS1 to show that induction of SOCS-3 by EPAC requires phospholipase C (PLC) ε. Investigation into downstream effectors of PLC action lead to the identification of PKCα and PKCδ as essential components of this pathway, further elucidating a mechanism by which cyclic AMP can affect inflammation and revealing a point of crosstalk between the two signalling pathways.\\n\\nFurther elaborating on the identification of PKC isoforms α and δ as crucial components in the control of cytokine signalling by cyclic AMP via EPAC, investigations into the effect of cyclic AMP on PKC α and δ activation and autophosphorylation, and on downstream effectors, were carried out. It was revealed that cyclic AMP had no influence on PKCδ activity, although a role for cyclic AMP signalling through EPAC on the activation and autophosphorylation of PKCα was identified. Additionally, phosphorylation of the downstream kinase ERK was found to occur independently of PKC activation and required the presence of EPAC1 in COS1 cells.\\n\\nThe work presented in this thesis therefore begins to delineate a novel pathway in which the cyclic AMP and PKC pathways work together to afford cell regulation, including the regulation of gene expression, through novel areas of crosstalk.'], 'Rank_3_cosdis': [0.027025771828971812], 'Rank_4_id': [99719], 'Rank_4_Title': ['Opposing Changes in Phosphorylation of Specific Sites in Synapsin I During Ca2-Dependent Glutamate Release in Isolated Nerve Terminals'], 'Rank_4_Abstract': ['Synapsins are major neuronal phosphoproteins involved in regulation\\r\\nof neurotransmitter release.

Here, we characterised the actions of the R-(+)- and S-(−)-enantiomers of etomidate. In mice and tadpoles, R-(+)-etomidate was more potent (˜10-fold) than S-(−)-etomidate in producing loss of the righting reflex. In electrophysiological and radioligand binding assays, the enantiomers of etomidate positively regulated GABAA receptor function at anaesthetic concentrations and with an enantioselectivity paralleling their in vivo activity. GABA-evoked currents mediated by human recombinant GABAA receptors were potentiated by either R-(+)- or S-(−)-etomidate in a manner dependent upon receptor subunit composition. A direct, GABA-mimetic, effect was similarly subunit dependent. Modulation of GABA receptor activity was selective; R-(+)-etomidate inhibited nicotinic acetylcholine, or 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptor subtypes only at supra-clinical concentrations and ionotropic glutamate receptor isoforms were essentially unaffected. Acting upon reticulothalamic neurones in rat brain slices, R-(+)-etomidate prolonged the duration of miniature IPSCs and modestly enhanced their peak amplitude. S-(−)-etomidate exerted qualitatively similar, but weaker, actions. In a model of locomotor activity, fictive swimming in Xenopus laevis tadpoles, R-(+)- but not S-(−)-etomidate exerted a depressant influence via enhancement of GABAergic neurotransmission.
